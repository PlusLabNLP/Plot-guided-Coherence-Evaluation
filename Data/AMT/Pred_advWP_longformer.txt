He was n't sure if it was a woman , but she was n that much more beautiful than the other knights he 'd met . She was a beautiful woman , with dark hair and eyes that were just as blue as the sky . She had a small smile that would make you smile for days , and a laugh that would shake your world as it were . She looked like a woman who had seen the world and was a knight , and she was a warrior . She wore a black cloak and a black helm that was covered in a black hood , and her hair was a deep brown , and it was tied back with a black leather belt . She held a sword that was made of a silver blade , and the blade was made from a thin silver chain , and was held in her right hand . Her eyes were black , but they were a deep blue , and they shone like the sun . The eyes were n't as bright as the sun , but the eyes were as bright . She stood in front of him , and he could n't help but feel a sense of relief . He was n' t afraid of her . He had saved her life , and now she was here , in the middle of the night , in front in front with him , with a sword in her hand . He could n'T help but smile , as he saw the tears in her eyes , and then he saw that she was crying . He looked down at the sword in his hand , and saw a small amount of blood on it , and his heart sank . He knew what she was going to do to him . He did n't know what she would do to me , but he knew she was right . He pulled out the sword , and as he did so , he saw her eyes . She could n 't see him . She did n ' t see him , but it was clear that she could see him ! She was n 'T afraid of him . The sword was a dark green , and had a silver chain around it , but that was n Spain . She drank from the flask in her arm . She stared at the knight with her eyes and smiled . She took the sword from his hand and put it on the ground . She pulled the sword out of her hands , and looked at him . `` I 'm sorry , '' she said . `` You did n't know . '' He looked at her , and smiled back . She smiled back , and took the blade from his hands . `` It 's okay , '' he said . He put the sword on the floor , and watched it fall to the ground , and moved it to the side , and pulled it back . `` Do n't worry , '' the knight said . The knight looked up at him , then to the sky , and laughed . `` So you 're the knight that saved my life , '' said the knight , `` and you 've saved mine . ''	3.505839231365826e-06
I 've been thinking about this for a long time . I 've never really been a fan of the idea of a `` God , '' but I 'm starting to think it 's a bit of a myth . The idea of the divine is a bit silly . I mean , I do n't know why I 'd want to believe that , but I guess I do . I do think that I 'll be able to understand it in a way that I can understand it more . I think that the God is a being that is not of this world , but a being of the universe . I believe that the creator of the Universe is a person who is not at all like us , but something else . I also think that it 'll exist in a place where it 'd be a bit more like us . There are many things that I do not understand . There is a lot of things that are not like us and there is a whole lot of other things that do not exist . But I think I 'mma try to understand them . I have a lot to learn . I can not explain it all . I ca n't explain the universe , the universe is not like we are . I guess that 's why I am so interested in the idea that God is not a god . I feel that he is a god , but he is not the God of the world . He is not an entity that is just like us but a part of us . He has a mind , a body , and a soul . He does not know that we are the same , but we are not . He could not understand that we have a soul , he could not comprehend that we all have a mind . We are not all the same . We all have different minds , but some of us are the most similar . We have the same values , we all believe the same thing , but different opinions , and we all feel the same way . I hope that you can understand that . I am not sure that I have the answers to some of these questions . I only know that I am trying to understand the universe as it is , and I 'M trying to find the truth . I want to understand what it is that I believe in . I love it . I know that it is not God . I just do n Kosovo . I wish that I could understand it . If I did I would be able . I would know that God might be more like me . I could be the same as you . I wonder what it would be like to be like you .	3.5014220429729903e-06

I was born into a family of doctors . I was born in a family that was very well off . My father was a doctor , my mother a surgeon . My mother was a nurse . I had a sister , a brother , and a father . I grew up in a house with a lot of people , and I was a senior in high school . My parents were very good to me , but I never felt like I was the best . I never had much friends , and my sister was the only one who could talk to me . I 'd had a lot to say , but she would n't let me speak . She would n'mpt me out of the room and I would have to go to the hospital to talk to her . I would n Tinder her , and then I ''d get into a fight with her , but my father would n1968 . He was a good man , he was a great man , and when he died , he left me a lot . I did n't know what to do . I should have known that I would be haunted by him . I tried to go on with my life . I could n't . I just could n’ t . I thought I would die , and it would be easy . I didn ’ t want to die . I knew that I was n't good enough . I wanted to save people . I ’ d always wanted to help people . But I could never do it . I couldn ’� t save people , because I was just too scared of what I �Phillip would think . I wouldn ’'t be able to save them . I hung up the phone , and went to bed . I woke up in my bed , and started to cry . I looked up at the ceiling , and saw a light on . I wished I had been able to stop it . That ’ s when I saw him . He stood there , looking at me . He had a smile on his face , and he looked like he was about to say something , but he didn ‘ t . He just stood there . He didn “ turn around , ” and he walked away . I sat up in bed , my heart racing . I wasn ’T sure what to say . I decided to make a phone call to my father , and told him to come home . I need to talk with him . It was a long night , and the phone was ringing . I got up , and walked to the phone . I picked it up , but there was no answer . I put the phone down , and stared at the screen . I opened the phone and saw the number of my father . He looked at me , and said , “ Hello ? ” “ I “ am , ’ I said , and that ’ ll be all I need. ” I hung the phone up , expecting a call from my father or mother . I walked back to my bed and sat down , my head in my hands . I felt like a ghost .	3.506862640278996e-06
I 've been doing this for a while now . I 've had to get used to the idea . I do n't know why I do it . I mean , I 'm not sure how I got here . I guess I just figure it 's just a part of my job . I knew I was a good guy . I was born to be a keymaster . I never wanted to be the keymaster , but I was the only one who could . I had to be . I started out as a kid , and I was never the best at it . My parents were n't happy with me , and they were nt happy with my actions . They told me I was n't good enough , and now I 'd never be good enough . I got my start as a child , and it was n snap of a finger . My mother was n Parkinson 's , and my father was a farmer . I lost my parents when I was six . I did n't like that , and never wanted them to be angry with me . I grew up , and then I started working for a bank . I worked in the bank , and when I got out , I was labelled a villain . I became a thief . I stole the identities of villains . I took the identities and identities of heroes . I killed villains . And then I did it again . I went back to work . I thought I 'll be a hero . I made a name for myself . I ran around the world , and freed villains from prison . I set up a bank , I made enemies , and eventually I was able to get the key to the key . I used the key , and the key was given to me . The key to my life . I am the key of the world . I have made many a hero , and many a villain , but the key is the key that makes me who I am . I can make a hero out of any villain , and no one will ever stop me . They 'll call me the Keymaster . They wo n't call me anything else . I think I 's going to be very famous . I hope . I just hope they do n conduc to be happy . I see a few of my villains are going to die . I know they 'll die . They will die . But I ' m going to make them happy . The Keymaster , the key I 'M going to give them . I will make them smile . I want them to love me .	3.6635346987168305e-06
I 'm sorry I have n't been able to do this in years . The last time I wrote a speech was in the middle of a storm . I 've been working on this for over a year now and I still ca n't quite get the words out . I do n't know how to even write a speech anymore . I know I 'll never get it right . I have to make sure I make it right , I have a lot of work to do . I am the captain of the Captain 's ship , the largest ship in the sea , and I am responsible for the survival of the crew . I ca n 't take this job for granted . I want to be the best captain I can be , I want my crew to be happy , I need to be able to fit in , I 'm not sure I can . I need a new ship . I got ta get out of here . I just need to get the ship to the coast . I can do this . I will be the captain , I will get it ! I have the knowledge to do it ! The crew will be happy . I must go . I shall take the ship . If I 'd been able . If only I could have done this before . I had to make it , I would n't have to do that . I would have been able , but I could n't . I wish I could . I was n't able to , I ca't . The ship is too big , the crew is too strong . I could never get the crew to move . I keep telling myself I ' m not going to do anything . I really wish I had n't made it . I should n't be the Captain . I did n't make it . The crew is my only hope . I reached into my pocket and pulled out a small box of coins . I put them in the box and handed them to the captain . I told him to open it and to hold onto it . He took a look and said , `` This is my first time doing this , I did this before , I do it . '' The captain took the coins and handed it to me . I took the money and walked out of the ship , I looked around the ship and saw the crew , they were all in the ship as well . I walked up to the Captain and told him that I wanted to take the treasure . I asked if he wanted to be my captain . He said yes . I followed him and we went to the deck and I asked him if he was ready . He was . We took the treasure and we walked back to the ship for a little bit . I said , I am going to be a good captain , and that I want a ship that can take care of my crew . He replied , `` I am ready to do what I can to make this ship a better ship . '' I said . I gave him a look , he looked at me , and he said , '' I am not ready to let you go . '' He took the gold and gave it to us . I looked at the crew and said : `` I know what I want .

`` You 're not a wizard , '' I said . The man in the white suit and black tie turned to me , his eyes wide and his mouth agape . `` You 've been summoned . '' `` I am not a mage , '' he said . `` I 'm a soldier . '' I was n't sure what to say . `` What ? '' I asked . `` A soldier ? '' He looked at me with a blank expression . `` No , '' He said , `` you are a soldier , '' `` A man of the dead . '' He turned to look at me . `` Why ? '' `` Because I am the only one who can summon them . '' The man turned to the side , his face pale and his eyes glazed over . `` How ? '' The old man looked at the man in black , his mouth open in a silent scream . `` They were a force of nature , '' the old man said . I looked at him , my mouth agaped . `` And they are dead . I am a soldier of the undead , '' The soldier said . My mouth dropped open . `` Are you ... you are ... a soldier ? What do you mean ? '' he asked . He turned back to the old gentleman , his voice quavering . `` The soldiers were not born dead . They were killed by the undead . '' My mouth hung open . I could n't believe it . I was a soldier ! I was the only soldier in the world ! `` Do you mean that you are the only man who can summons them ? '' the man asked . I nodded , `` I can . '' he whispered . `` Then why are you here ? '' My voice was shaking . `` Because you are dead , '' a voice said . It was the old men . The old men looked at each other . `` We are dead ? '' They nodded . `` Yes , '' said the man , `` we are dead ! '' `` That is not true , '' they said . They all turned to face me . I had to know what to do . I did n't know what I had done . I just knew that I had a choice to make . I walked over to the man and grabbed him by the arm . `` Please , ''I said , and he shook his head . `` Do n't do it , '' asked the old mans voice . `` It is n't true , I am dead . You are dead too . '' They all nodded . I turned to leave . `` So , '' one of them said . He looked up at me , `` are you the only person who can control the elements ? ''	3.518238145261421e-06
`` How long has it been ? '' The scientist asked . `` I do n't know , I do not know , '' I answered . `` But it 's been a while , '' he said , `` It 's about a year and a half now . '' `` I know , but I 'm not sure I 've ever seen anything like this before . '' I said . `` You know what I mean , '' the scientist said , his eyes brightening . `` We have n't been able to find a catalyst . '' He looked at me , his cheeks turning red , `` You 've been working on this for a long time , and we 've never found one . '' The scientists were all silent . `` What ? '' I asked . The scientist nodded , `` I 'll tell you what . '' They all stared at me . `` It started with a single soul . It was n't a soul at first . It took a few years , but it started to become a body . It started as a single human . '' he continued . `` Then it became a soul . '' My heart began to race . `` So , '' He said , nodding . `` Now , we have found a soul that is n't human . It 'll be our first step in curing cancer . '' We all looked at each other . `` Well , what are we going to do ? '' `` We 're going to put it to the test , '' said the scientist . `` Let 's get it on the table . '' we all looked around . `` How long ? '' He asked . He looked around again . `` Like , a year ? '' We nodded . `` No , '' we said , and he turned to leave . `` Not a week . '' His eyes turned to me . He pulled out a small , white ball of paper . `` This is what we 're gon na do . '' It was a small piece of paper , and it was the only thing that would stop the cancer . `` Do you think it 'll work ? '' he asked . I looked at it . `` Yes , '' it said . It had a small circle on it . It said , '' It 'd work . '' This was the first time I had ever seen a soul , and I was curious . `` And what is it ? '' It asked . We all nodded . We looked at the ball . `` Is it a soul ? '' the Scientist asked . It nodded . The scientists looked at us . `` Okay , '' they said . The man turned back to the ball , `` What do you think ? '' we asked . They all looked up at me and nodded . I nodded back . `` There 's a soul in there . '' they all said . I stared at it in disbelief . `` Where is it coming from ?

`` You have been selected to be the head of the United Nations . '' `` I 'm sorry , what ? '' `` You 're the head . '' The President 's voice was calm , but the tone of his voice was deep and hard . `` I have been chosen to be your leader .

I am John Doe . I am a completely forgettable person . I have no friends , no family , no one to talk to . I never have a job , no friends . I do n't even have a girlfriend . I 'm a complete and utter bore . I wake up every morning and go to work . I go to bed at night and wake up in the morning .

That I will never see my family again . That they will never know me . That my life is a waste of theirs . I wonder what I will do with my life . I start to cry . I remember that I will eventually die . But I ' m not ready . I ca n't do it . I will not die .	3.8066220895416336e-06
`` What the hell is this ? '' God asked himself . He had seen the world so many times before . He watched as the world was created , and he had seen so many different things , but this was the first time it had happened to him . He was shocked . He saw the world for the first and only time in his life . `` What is this , God ? '' the man asked . `` It 's an Easter egg ! '' God said . `` Ah , I see . '' God sighed . `` Well , it 's a little hard to believe . '' `` I suppose it is . '' The man replied . `` But I 'm sure it 'll be fine . '' He said . God looked at the man . `` I can see it . '' And then the man went back to his work . `` Wait , you 're telling me that this is a Easter egg ? '' `` Yes . '' said God . `` This is a very important one . '' * '' I 've never seen one like this before . '' Said the man , `` Well I 's not sure if I 'd believe you . '' After a moment , God nodded . `` That 's what I 'll give you . It 'll make you think .

It was that of a man who had just been given the gift of creation . `` And what do you want ? '' The boy asked . God was confused . `` Oh , I do n't know . I ' m not sure .

I took it from the sky . ''God nodded . He knew what the boy was saying . He could see the man looked at him . `` Okay . '' His voice was high pitched . `` So , what are you going to do ? '' He asked . He said , `` I do a little thing . '' “ And what 's that ? '' ” I do that . '' A voice said . “ Well , I 're not sure , but it 'd be a good idea to take it out .

`` I 've been reading this for the past few minutes , but I ca n't believe it . '' I looked at the diary . `` It 's been so long since I read it . I 'm so sorry . '' `` What ? '' `` It was a long time ago . '' My eyes widened . `` What do you mean , it 's so long ago ? '' I went on . `` I mean , you 've read it since you were a baby .

`` Okay , so we 're here , we 've got a little bit of a surprise for you . '' `` I 'm sorry , what ? '' `` Well , we found a fish . '' The audience was silent , staring at the television . `` A fish ? '' The moderator was still staring at it , but it seemed to be a bit more concerned than the audience . `` Yeah , it 's a fish , '' the President said , `` I mean , it was a fish-like creature . '' He paused , `` It was a ... a fish with a big head and a big mouth . It was really ... it was ... '' `` What ? '' the audience was still silent . `` It 's like a fish ? ! '' `` It had a big body , and it was tentacles . It had long , sharp , sharp teeth , and long , long , crooked claws . It 'd be a very , very good candidate .

'' asked the moderator . `` I think it 're a fish on Jupiter , '' said the President . `` What 's the name of it ? '' It was the President 's turn to be startled . `` Oh , it looks like a- '' `` No , '' replied the moderator , `` it 'll be a fish ! '' The crowd was still quiet , but the President was starting to get nervous . `` We 're going to have to postpone the debate , '' he said . `` The President is going to be late . '' A few seconds later , the moderator was back . `` Well ... '' the president said , and the audience began to get louder . `` Listen , '' they said , all at once , `` we 'll have to stop the debate . '' They were getting louder . The moderators were getting more and more nervous . The audience began shouting , `` The debates are over ! The debate is over ! '' and the moderator started to get more nervous , `` We have to cancel the debate ! '' He was about to say something , but a few seconds before he could , the President began to scream . `` YEAH , I 'll do it ! '' he shouted . The crowd began to laugh , but they were all silent . They were all laughing at the President , and at the fact that he was laughing . The moderator took a moment to compose himself , `` What the hell is going on here ? '' he asked . `` You know , '' `` This is the final debate , sir , '' The President said . He was trying to put on a brave face . `` This will be the last debate , and we have to end it .

I was sent to fight in the war . I had a mission to do . I was told I was a soldier , and I was going to do it . I read the papers , I was trained , I had everything in place . I knew what I had to do , and it was going through my mind . I got up , and went to the door . I looked at the door , and saw the soldiers . I tried to get a good look at them , but I could n't . I could feel the heat of the sun on my face , and the sweat on my brow . I turned around , and there they were . The men in the uniforms . They were all wearing the same uniform as I was , but they were all different . They had different colored uniforms , and they were different colors . Some of them wore the same clothes , and some had different colors of uniforms , but none were the same as me . I glanced over at the men in suits . They all had the same uniforms . I walked over to the man in the suit . He was the only one who had the black uniform . He looked at me , and said , `` I am the only person who has the same name as you . '' I nodded . `` I 'm sorry , sir . '' `` You are the only man who has ever been drafted into the military . '' He said . `` You 're the only guy that has ever fought in the Army . '' My eyes widened . `` What ? '' I asked . `` No , sir , I 've been drafted . '' The man in suits said . He stood up and walked to the other side of the room , and pointed to the window . `` Look , sir ? '' `` The war . '' he said . I shook my head . `` The only thing that has been good for me is war . The war is good for everyone . '' There was a pause . `` And that 's why I 'll be staying here . '' A man in a black uniform said . My eyes went wide . `` We 're not going to be able to do this anymore . '' It was a young man , but he was a man . He wore a suit . `` So , what are you going to fight for ? '' The young man asked . He had the accent of a German soldier . `` Well , sir I 'd like to fight . '' And he walked back to the room . `` Not for you . I 's going to go back to my place . ''	3.552727093847352e-06
I found the hall , it was a grand hall , filled with ancient weapons , old and new . I was n't sure what I was expecting , but I was excited . I had never seen such a place before . I even had my own room , a room that I could call my own . I walked through the hall to the end of the hall and walked towards the main door . I could n't help but look down at the weapon . It was nolithic , almost like a giant , it had a large , round stone in the center , and a massive handle . The handle was a beautiful red , like a sword , with a round , golden handle . I looked down at it . I knew that this was the weapon that I would wield . I picked it up , and felt the weight of it on my shoulders . It felt like I was going to be able to control it . The weight of the sword was like a weight on my chest , like I could feel the weight on the back of my neck . I took a deep breath and stepped forward . I felt the ground begin to shake , and I felt my heart begin to race . I did n't know what to do . I stood there , looking at the sword , and the world around me . I realized that I was the one who was supposed to wield it . It did n presents itself to me as a weapon of power , and it was my weapon . I held it up to my chest and looked at it , and saw that it was as beautiful as I had imagined . I opened my mouth to speak , but nothing came out . I stared at it for a moment , and then I heard a voice . It said , `` I am the sword of the gods , and you are not worthy to wield this weapon . '' I took my weapon from my chest . I heard it say , `` You are not unworthy to wield my sword , but you are worthy to have it . '' It spoke , `` Do not fear , for I am not the sword . '' The voice was quiet , and there was no emotion . I put my sword down , and looked down . I saw a sword in the ground , and realized that it had been left there for me . It spoke again , `` Please do not fear ! '' I looked back at the door , and found it was still open . I stepped inside . I turned around , and heard the voice again . `` I will not fear . '' And I walked out of the room , and into the hall .	3.565478891687235e-06
I 'm not sure how long it 's been since I 've seen her . I 'm afraid to say it 'll be a while . I know she 's gone , but I 'll never forget the first time I saw her . She was sitting on the sofa , her back to me . She smiled at me , her eyes a soft , blue , and her hair was long and blonde . She looked like she was looking for a moment , and I could n't help but feel like I was looking at her . It was a lovely , beautiful smile , and she was so happy . She 'd been waiting for me to come home , and it was so nice to see her . Her eyes were still looking at me . I do n't know why I did n't tell her what I was doing , but that was n't important . I just wanted to see what she looked like . I did . I was so glad she was n aisle three , so she could nuzzle up to me and kiss me and say `` I love you '' . It 's just so beautiful . She made me laugh . I love her . We 've been together for years , and we 're the best of friends . I can tell she 'll always love me . It seems like she 'd already know . I ca n't remember the last time I had a conversation with her . My heart feels like it 'd be broken . I want to tell her I love me , but all I can think about is the day I 'd go to bed . I wish I could tell her that I loved her . That I loved the way she felt about me . That her smile would always be there , and that I 's how I 'D remember her . But I ca't . I have n't seen her in a while , and the last thing I 'M going to remember is her smile . I wo n't be able to see it . I hate that I ca I ' m not going to see that smile . No . I will never see that smiling face again . I miss her . And I 're so sorry . I need to go to sleep . I should n't have left her . The sun is setting . I must be going to sleep , but then I ' Carla will come home . I keep telling myself that . I am going to go home . And when I wake up , I ' ll see her again . If I ' 'll see her , I will see her smile again .	3.5120804113830673e-06
`` I 'm sorry sir , I 've been thinking about this . '' `` I know , '' I said . `` It 's a little late to be talking about this , but I 'll get to it later . '' I walked over to the fire station and sat down . I could hear the sirens from the fire department . `` We 're going to need you to get out of here . '' The fireman said . I said nothing . I was n't sure what to say . `` I do n't know , I do . '' He said . He was a tall man , with a thick beard and a long mustache . He had a dark green shirt , and a black tie . He looked like he was in his late 20s . `` Well , I have to go , '' he said . But I could n't tell if he was kidding or not . `` If you 're not going to be a firefighter , I will be . '' And I did n't say anything . `` What 's that ? '' I asked . `` You 're a firefighter ? '' `` That 's right . '' he replied . `` And you 've got a job to do . I 'd like to be on the front line . ''He said . The firemen were n't going to like it . `` There 's nothing you can do , '' said the firefighter . `` The fire department is n't doing anything . I can only put out the fire . '' There was a pause . `` Are you sure ? '' The firefighter asked . I nodded . `` Sure . '' It was naught but a nod . `` Good . '' With that , he walked out of the firestation and down the hall . I followed him . `` Okay , '' the firefighter said . We were walking out the door . I looked back at the fire and the fireman . `` So , '' The Fireman said , `` what 's your name ? '' '' `` Steve . '' As we passed the firehouse , I said , and he said , '' Steve . What 'd you call me ? '' He put his hand on my shoulder . `` Steve , ''I said . And he nodded . I turned around and said , 'I 'm John . ' `` I 'M Steve . I do a lot of things . '' Steve said . As we walked away , I looked at thefire . I had to ask him to stop . `` Yeah , '' He told me . `` How many times have you done this ? ''	3.646187224148889e-06
I 'm not sure if I 'm supposed to say this , but I do n't think I 've ever been this close to death . I 'll never forget the first time I saw my wife . She was sitting on the couch , and I was standing outside , watching the rain . The rain was coming down in a steady , steady rhythm , and it was n't even a drop . I had no idea what was going on . I was staring at the sky , and the rain was falling harder than I had ever seen before . The sky was dark , and as I looked up I saw a big , dark cloud . I could n't see the clouds , but the clouds were getting darker and darker . I looked at my wife , and she was staring right back at me . I felt a sudden pain in my chest . I tried to pull away , but there was no way I could . I did n't want to move . I wanted to get away . I struggled to my feet , but my legs were n't cooperating . I grabbed the railing , and tried to get up . I saw an opening . I jumped , but it was too late . I fell to the ground , and my body was pinned to the floor . I heard a scream . I got up and looked around . I swear I saw something move . A man , maybe 20 , was standing in front of me , and he was wearing a suit . He was smiling , and his hair was blonde . He looked like he was about to cry , but he did nernel , and was smiling . I turned around , and there was a man in a suit , with a mask on . The man was talking to me , but his voice was rough , and sounded like a man who had been crying . He had a gun in his hand , and a gun on his head . `` You 're going to die , '' he said , and then he turned around and pointed it at me , `` You are going to live . '' He pointed the gun at me again , and said , `` I 'd like to live , '' and he turned back to the man . `` I want you to live '' . I just stared at him . I knew he was going to be gone . I watched him walk away , and everything went black . I woke up the next morning , and looked at the clock , and saw it was 8:10 . I sat up , and went to the kitchen . I took a sip of water , and noticed that the clock was still at 8:15 . I walked to the bathroom , and turned the water on . It was still 8:30 . I started to get dressed , and got ready for work . I decided to go to the bar , and see what I could find to drink . I went to a bar , but no one was there . I ran back to my house , and walked into my kitchen . My wife was there , and we sat down , and talked . I told her what I had heard . She smiled , and told me that I was going extinct . I said , I was n`'t going to kill myself . I asked her if she was going away , too . She said she was n' t going away . She looked at me with a smile , and asked , `` Why ? '' I told me , this was n ' t my fault , and to not be afraid of death . She asked me , 'Why did you say that ? ' I told them , 'Because I was afraid of being dead . ' I said I was scared of being alive , and that I wanted my life to be over . I remember the man 's face , and how he looked at it . I remembered the man who said , 'I 'll be back .

The world is a strange place . The stars are bright , the moon is bright , and the moon itself is bright . The world is green . The sun is bright and bright , but the sky is dark . The earth is dark , but it is not bright . It is dark because the sun is not the sun . The moon is dark and dark . It 's dark because it is dark ; it is black because it does not have light . The sky is black and the sun , it is cold and dark , and it is still . The clouds are black and dark and the stars are black , but they are not bright , they are dark . There is a dark , dark blue sky , but there is a light . There are stars , but no stars . The light is not black , it 's blue , and there is not light . It has a light , but not a light so dark that it is nothing . The life is not dark , it has a dark . Everything is dark ! It is not white , it ca n't be . It can not be . The darkness is not a color . It ca n not be a color , it can not have a color ! It can be any color , but this is not it . The dark is not green , it does n't have a colour . The color is not blue , it means nothing . It does not exist . The shadow is not there . The black is not in the sky , it mean nothing . There must be something there , but what ? It is cold . The blue is not cold , it must be cold . There should be something in the air , but ... there is nothing there . There was nothing there , it was cold . It was not cold . And then it was warm . It felt warm . There were no colds , it did not feel cold , It was warm , it felt warm , It felt hot . The air was warm and it was hot . It seemed to be hot , it seemed to feel warm . The heat was not hot , there was nothing . But it was not warm , there were no hot , the air was not Hot , it weighed no more than a few pounds . The warmest thing in the world was not that hot , but that was not the coldest thing . It did not know how to feel . The cold was not cool , it had no heat . The warmth was not real . The hot was not a warm , not a cold , not that warm , but something . It had no warmth . The coolness was not what it felt , it could not feel . It could not be felt . The only thing that was real was the cold . But the cold was warm because it was the only thing in this world . The chill was not from the cold , but from the air . The shaking was not in a cold sweat , it came from the heat . It came from a cold .	3.502641220620717e-06
I was born in the middle of the night , and I was born on a Sunday . I 've been walking home for a long time , but I never know what day it is . It 's hard to remember , but the fact that I 'm still alive is a sign that I was never born . I remember that I got my first job as a messenger , and that was the first time I ever saw a woman . I was so excited when I saw her . She was beautiful , and she was so happy . She looked like a little girl , and her eyes were bright and full of life . I do n't know what she was thinking , but she was happy . I have n't seen her since . I look at her now , and the smile on her face is still there . She 's still the same , but it 's not the same . I see her now . I know she 's the same as she was when I was a kid . She is still the girl I knew , but now she 'll always be a girl . I ca n't remember the first day I met her , but that does n't matter . I never saw her again . I still remember her smile , but not the way I remember her . I loved her . That 's all I remember . I love her . The only thing I remember is the smile . I can remember the way she looked at me , and how she looked back at me . She still smiled , but her smile was a bit different . I think she was smiling at me now . She looks at me with the same smile that she had back then . I saw the smile that I had when I first met her . It was a smile that meant I was loved . I felt like I could see her smile now . It made me happy . Her smile was still there , but a little more so now . Her face was still the exact same . She did n't look like she was sad anymore . She seemed like she 'd never been sad before . I looked at her , and saw the same expression that I saw in her before . She smiled back , and it was still her smile . She had a smile now , but no longer was it a smile of happiness . She just looked at my face , and smiled . She then looked up at me and smiled again . She said , `` I love you , '' and she smiled . I smiled back . I left the hospital . I did n too . I could n't believe what I saw . I had never seen her smile before . My life was over . I walked home , and felt the same way I did when I felt the smile , and then I was gone .	3.53234486283327e-06
`` No act of kindness , no matter how small , is ever wasted . '' The words were spoken by a young man in a white coat , his eyes wide and his face pale as he looked up at the sky . `` I am a man of the world , and I have been given a gift . '' A man in the back of the crowd was looking down at his feet , a small smile on his face . `` And I am the only one who can take it from you , and make it yours . '' `` And what is it ?

The crowd cheered again . `` Then , I have no choice but to give you the gift . I am not the only person who can make you happy . '' and the boy stood up , and his voice was still . `` Thank you , sir , '' a man in white coat said , as he walked out of the room , and away from the crowd . `` Do n't you think that 's a gift ? Do you think I am just a man who gives you something ?

A young woman in a red coat said . He walked out and out the front door . The young woman looked at him , and she smiled . `` Well , '' she said , her voice was soft and soft . `` Can I ask you a question ? '' he asked , and then she said : `` What 's the price of a gift you can give ? ''	3.493363919915282e-06

`` I know I 'm not the best roommate , but I 've been here for two years and I 'll do anything to get out of this .

I 'm not sure how I got here . I guess I just walked in , and a little bit of a jerk . I 'm pretty sure I 've never been on a plane before , but I 'll give it a shot . I got a seat in the back . It 's a small plane , so I 'd have to sit on the window seat and wait for the flight attendants to come . I do n't know if I 'M going to be able to fly , but it 's the only way to go . I could n't be in the passenger seat , but what the hell . I would be in a plane . I did n't even know how to get on the plane . So I did . I just sat there , and waited . I was n't sure how long it would take them to come , but they did . They came , and I was in the right place , and they were n't going to take me . They were n to take the plane , and that was the end of it . I looked around . I saw the flight attendant , and she was nnie . She was a pretty girl , and was nt the most attractive woman I ' had ever seen . I knew I was going to die . I tried to get up , but she was too strong . I heard her scream . She screamed , and then she fell to the ground . I panicked . I felt like I was under a bus . I thought I was dead . I started screaming , but then I heard the flight controller say something . `` What the fuck ? '' I asked . `` I do- '' I was cut off by the sound of the plane crashing . I opened my eyes , and saw the other passengers . I had n't seen them before . They all looked the same . The flight attendant was nn't a pretty woman . She looked like she was in her forties , and had long brown hair . She had a big nose . I assumed she was a doctor . `` It 'll be alright , '' she said . `` You 'll find out . '' I said . I sat down , and felt a little uncomfortable . I stared at her . I wanted to ask her what she was talking about . She did n t know what to say . I told her I was getting on the flight , but the flight crew had n Safer . I asked if she wanted to go back to the plane and get a seat . `` No , '' the flight engineer said . The plane was on autopilot . I said , `` I 's going to have to get off . '' `` But I 're going to go aboard , '' I told the flight assistant . `` We 're not going to let you leave . '' She said . She said , and we both got up . I walked to the door . I grabbed the door , and looked out the window . I stopped . I then saw the plane crash . I kicked it , and the plane was gone . I ran back to my seat . I called the flight officer , who came running out . `` Hey , you 're right , '' he said . He was nnah . `` Where are you ? '' `` I was on the ground , '' said I . `` Oh , '' responded the flight instructor . `` So , where are you going ? '' he asked . He looked at me . `` Well , '' `` Well ... '' I started , and he looked at him . `` And ... '' `` What ? '' He said . Then he looked back at the plane again . `` How are you doing ? ''	3.5324796954228077e-06

`` So , how was heaven ? '' `` It was wonderful , '' I replied . `` I 'm glad you asked . '' `` Oh , I 've been here for so long , '' God replied . I had been here a long time , but I had never been so happy to see him . `` How 'd it go ? '' He asked . `` Well , I guess it 's a bit of a blur . '' I said . `` What ? '' God asked .

He turned to me . `` You 're not sure ? '' he asked . His eyes were wide , and he was shaking . `` No , I do n't know . '' He said . I stood up and walked away . `` Oh . '' God was still staring at me . He gave me a look of confusion . `` But how was it ? '' But I could n't answer . `` It 's like heaven , '' He replied . He smiled . `` And how was my life ? '' His eyes went wide . `` My life ? I 'd say it was good . '' His voice was so deep , so calm . `` That 's what you said . '' The room was quiet . `` Is that so ? '' said God . `` Yes , '' said I . `` Then , how did you get here ? '' A small smile spread across my face . `` In a way , it was narteries . '' '' I looked up at him . He was smiling . `` Are you sure ? I mean , I know you 're here , but you do n Pentagon work . '' And he was . `` God , I have n't seen you in so long . '' There was a pause . `` Do you have any idea how long it 'll be before you get to see me ? '' The smile on his face was gone . `` A long time . '' It was the first time I had seen him smile . `` Yeah , I feel like I 'll see you again . '' That 'd be good . `` Now , how 'd your life end ? '' Jesus asked . God sighed . `` The way I see it , I was n'er the one who died . '' Jesus looked at his hands . `` Did you die ? ''	3.55589622813568e-06
It was a nice day , the sun was shining and the clouds were as dark as ever . The sun was just beginning to set . I had a nice view of the city , the streets were empty , the sky was blue , and the sky itself was clear . I walked down the street , my eyes were focused on the street . I was walking , I was n't looking . I could n't see the road , I could not see anything . I did n't know what to do . I looked up at the sky , it was dark . I saw a man walking up the street and I saw him . He was dressed in a suit , the same one I had seen before . I ran over to him , I ran my hand over his face , I felt his hand . I felt the blood , the blood that was on his face . He had a gun in his hand , he was trying to kill me . He started to run . I followed him , it did n’ t take long for me to catch up to him . I got to him and I was in his face and he was looking at me with an angry look on his eyes . I started to cry . I put my hands on his shoulders and I felt him pull away from me . I pulled him into a hug , I kissed him and he looked at me and said , “ I love you. ” I was still crying . I kissed his cheek and then I felt a cold breeze hit me . It was cold . I fought it off , I had to . I took him in my arms and I held him close . I held his hand and I kissed it . I let him go and I let go of his hand as I let his arm go . I closed my eyes and I told him I loved him and that I would always love him . So I kissed the back of his head and I hugged him . His hands were cold . He kissed me back . I touched his lips and I heard him say , ‘ I love your mother . ’ I kissed my mom and I said , I love her . I woke up in my bed and I had n't eaten in a while . I loved my mom . I love my mom , I loved her . When I woke I was sitting in my room , I saw my dad , he had a handgun in his hands . He looked at my mom with a look of horror on his Face . He said , `` I love mom , you 're not my son . I told you that . I found the gun . I killed you . I have to kill you . You 're my son. ’ He said . I cried . I said I love him , but I love Mom . I hugged my mom again . I gave him a kiss . I asked him , ” Do you love mom ? ” He nodded . I smiled and I touched my mom ’ s face . I whispered , ’ She is my mother . I went to my room and I took out my phone and I called my mom to tell her that I loved you . She said , 'I love you too . I 'm sorry . I will always love you . ‘	3.498234718790627e-06
`` I wish I could go back in time . '' I say to the genie , as he sits there , staring at me . `` You wish you could go to the future ? '' I ask . `` No . I wish to go back to the past . '' `` I know . '' He says , as I look at him . `` I wish you would go back and change your biggest mistake . '' My heart sinks . `` What ? '' `` Your biggest mistake ? '' He asks . `` Yes . '' As I say this I feel a sharp pain in my stomach . `` My biggest mistake was not being a good guy . '' The genie looks at me with a blank look . `` Do you want to go to you now ? '' The guy looks at the genies face . `` That 's not how I see it . '' His eyes widen . `` Oh , really ? '' he says , `` That is so ... '' He looks at his hands . `` Sorry . '' his voice is filled with fear . `` The genies are not as bad as you think . '' But I can see him get scared . `` How do you know ? '' His voice is more desperate . `` Because I 'm a genie . '' he looks at my face . I can feel my heart pounding . `` It 's a bit of a shame , '' I think . `` But I wish not to be a genies . '' And with that he disappears . I look back at the time I made my biggest mistake , and I see myself in the past , looking at my own face . It 'll be okay . I 'll make sure of it . I am not a bad person . `` So , what do you want ? '' the geniest of genies asks . I ask , `` I want to be me . '' With that he is gone . I sit there in shock . `` Who the fuck is this ? '' my heart beats faster .

It was a quiet night . The only sound was the steady rhythm of the rain on the windows and the soft clang of the leaves as they fell . I could hear the heavy rain coming down from the trees . I stood up and walked to the window , and opened it . The rain was still falling , but it was much heavier now . I took a deep breath and opened the window . The sky was a deep blue , the air was crisp and the moonlight glistening off of it . It was a beautiful night , and I could feel the warmth of the sun on my face . I sat down on the couch and opened my laptop and started to type . I had been working on a story about a man named Jack . It seemed like a great story , but he was a bit of a mystery to me . He was a strange man , with a dark complexion and a long , dark hair . He had a lot of hair , and a short beard . He wore a white shirt , and black pants . He did n't look like he had much of a life . He looked like he was in his early twenties . He also had a beard , but his hair was more of a dark brown . He always had a black beard , and his hair had a dark dark brown hair . It looked like it was in a bad way , but I did n’ t think it was because it was dark . It just looked like his hair . I did not know how long he had been with me , but if I could tell , he was probably in his mid twenties . I told him I was going to go to bed , and he said he would stay up late . I went to bed and I heard the rain . I woke up in the morning and looked at the clock . It read 8:25 . I got up and went to the kitchen . I made breakfast . I opened the fridge and looked over to the fridge . I saw a bottle of water in the fridge , and grabbed it . I was starting to get thirsty , so I went in to the bathroom and took a drink . I looked at my hands and saw a bloodshot eye . I knew what it meant . I grabbed a knife and a knife , and started cutting the knife into the knife . I cut myself . I wondered if I should go back to bed . I heard a noise from the kitchen , and then the door opened . A man walked in , and asked me what I was doing in the kitchen and if I was ok . I said I was fine , and that I had just finished my breakfast . He asked me to come back to the living room . I listened to him for a while , and the man said he had a story to tell . He told me about a boy who was in the house with his father , and how he had to leave and go to the hospital . He said he was sick , and wanted to be there for him . He would be there to help him . I asked him why he was going . He explained that he was being sick , but that he could n't be there because he was too sick . He then told me how he was getting better , and about how he wanted to help Jack . I thought about it for a long time , and thought about how it was a good story . I started to cry . I remembered the man I had killed , and it was the only way I could think of to explain the man who had killed me . I cried for a few minutes . I then went to sleep , and woke up . I came back to my room and went back to sleep . I watched the rain fall , and felt the warmth from the sun . I slept for a little while , then I woke . I found myself in the livingroom , and went into the kitchen to get some water . I drank some water and went out to the dining room . There was a man in a white coat , and some kind of a hat . I walked over to him , and said , “ I think I ’ m going to have to go . ”	3.6797539451072225e-06

`` You 're not even fucking me , you fucking whore ! '' I said to her . `` You 've been here for years , you know that , right ? '' She said , her voice a bit louder than I thought it was supposed to be . `` Yeah , I know . '' I told her . I was n't going to lie , I 'd been in a bad mood . I 'm a man who 's been drinking a lot lately , and I 've started to get a little paranoid . `` So , what 's the problem ? '' she asked , her eyes wide . `` Well , I have n't had a date in a long time , '' I started , and she had a look of horror on her face . `` I 'll tell you what , '' she said , `` I do n't know why you 're so upset . '' `` I have no idea , '' `` Do you know what 'd happen if I did ? '' `` If you did ? You 'd be dead , '' said the witch . `` How could I know ? '' I asked . `` Because I 're the only one who can see you . '' She replied . `` What ? '' '' I was getting angry . `` If I did n't have a girlfriend , I would n't be here . '' The witch looked at me . `` Then why are you so angry ? '' The girl looked at the girl , and then at me , and finally at the witch , and back at me again . `` It 's not your fault , '' the witch said , and her voice grew louder . `` Why do naughts you ? '' My eyes narrowed . `` Are you fucking kidding me ? '' the girl asked . I looked at her . She was starting to get angry . I could n't help but feel a bit bad . `` But I 'am not . '' she continued . `` No , I am . '' My voice was getting louder . The girl frowned . `` Do n't you see ? You know that I 's a witch , '' She looked at my face .

`` So , what do we do ? '' `` I 'll tell you what we do . We go out there and find something . We 're going to find something to eat . '' `` What 's that ? '' I asked . `` We 'll find something , we 're gon na find something ! '' `` You 're not going to believe this . '' I replied . `` I do n't know what you 're talking about . '' My mother was getting a bit worried . `` It 's not what we 've been looking for . '' She said . `` What ? '' She asked . I sighed . `` You know what we are looking for ? '' Her eyes were getting red . `` Something ... '' I said , trying to find the right word . `` A thing . '' Her face was turning red . She was getting more and more worried . I could feel her shaking . `` There 's something out there . '' Shortly after I said that , the sky began to shake and the dust started to swirl . I was right . There was something out of place . It was a little bit bigger than a small bird . It had a red , red , and white hat . It looked like a bird . `` But it 's a bird ? '' My father asked . He was getting nervous . `` No . '' His voice was getting louder and louder . `` Why would a bird be out there ? '' The sky began swirling again . `` Because it 'll be there . I 'm sure of it . '' The mother said . I felt her shaking more . `` They 're coming . '' she said . It did n't sound like a dream . `` That 's right . '' A little bird . We took a step closer . `` Wait , what ? '' she asked . The wind was getting stronger and the sand was getting thicker . `` Yes . '' We could see it . The bird . The thing . `` The thing is out there , '' I told her . `` And it ' slighted us . '' Our mother was shaking now . `` Yeah . '' It was only then that I realized that we had n't seen anything . It kept getting closer . I saw it . It seemed to be moving . I started to panic . I had to get to the door . `` Where are you going ? '' the mother asked . We were about to leave . I looked at the door and saw the little bird staring back at us . `` Do n't go . '' That 'd be a bad idea . `` How are you gon na do that ? I 've got to find that bird . ''	3.6830540466326056e-06
`` Well , I 'm not sure if this is the best idea . '' The scientist said to the doctor as he handed him the paper . `` Well , if you 're going to do this , you 'll have to tell me what you 've done . '' `` I 've been working on this for years . I 'd never have to go through this . '' I said . `` I know . '' He said . The doctor said . He put the paper down . `` It 's the one that says 'I 'm going to be the catalyst for the fusion of the human soul . '' A smile crossed his face . `` What 's it say ? '' `` It says , 'I am the catalyst . ' '' `` What ? '' I asked . `` That 's what it says . '' My mouth dropped open . I was shocked . `` Are you saying ... '' `` You 're saying that it 's a human soul ? '' He asked . I looked at him with confusion . `` Yes . '' '' `` Then why are you doing this ? '' The doctor asked . He looked at me , then looked back at the paper , then back at me . `` Because I 'll be the catalytic agent . '' And he walked away . And I was left with the paper and the news . I had to go back and read it . I read it over again . I do n't know what to think . I think I 's going to have to talk to my wife . And then I remember . `` No , no , no . '' Then I started crying . I thought about how I ' was going to tell her . I sat in the hospital bed , in the bed of a dying man . I heard him crying . He finally spoke . `` You have to do it . '' he said . I stared at the papers . I could n't believe it . `` Why ? '' he asked . They were so beautiful . I wanted to cry . I did n't want to cry , but I did . I knew I could . `` because I ' am the catalytic agent . I am the receptor . '' But it was too late . I saw him die . I watched him die as the doctors said , `` You know , I really should n't have done this . I should have never done this , '' he told me . I hated him . I loved him . The scientist looked at the newspaper . `` So you 'd like to know what I did ? ''	3.7324509776226478e-06

`` I 'm a ghost . '' I said . I was sitting in my bed , watching the TV . It was a normal day . I 'd been watching the news , and I had n't seen a ghost in a while . I looked at the clock on the wall , and it read 7:05 . `` I 've been waiting for you for a while , '' I told her . `` You 've always been a ghost , '' she said . `` Years ago , '' `` I was a ghost ! '' I asked . `` Really ? '' `` Yes , '' She said . She looked at me , and her eyes were bright and filled with a smile . `` But I was n't always a ghost ? '' I smiled . `` No , you were n't , ''she said . Her eyes were still bright , and she was still smiling . `` Come on , '' i said . We sat in silence for a moment . `` So , '' he said , `` What was your life like ? '' she asked . I sighed . `` Well , '' my voice was quiet , `` I had a girlfriend . '' `` What ? '' She asked , `` That 's not what I meant . '' She looked up from her phone . `` Yes . '' He said . His eyes were gone , and he was sitting on the couch , staring at the ceiling . I thought he was going to say something , but he just looked at my face . `` How was your childhood ? '' He asked . It did n't take me long to realize that he was n butting in . `` It was good , '' the ghost said . He was n' t a ghost anymore . `` My parents were good people . They had a good life . '' His eyes looked at his phone again . `` They were great people . '' We sat there for a long time . `` What did you do with your life ? '' he asked . He looked at her , and his eyes were now bright and hungry . `` Oh , '' He told me . `` We had a great life . I got into the army , and got my first job . '' The ghost looked at him , and then back at me . He smiled . His face was now a smile , and the smile was full of joy . `` And you got married ? '' asked the ghost . `` Yeah , '' responded I . `` He was my best friend . '' Her smile grew wider . `` That was a good year , '' we said .	3.4922979921248043e-06
`` What the fuck is this ? '' I asked my father . `` A fucking war . '' He said . `` It 's a war , son . '' I said . I was the only one who could hear him . `` We 're fighting in the Middle East , '' he said , and I was supposed to be the one to tell him that . `` What do you mean ? '' He asked . `` I mean , we 're in a war . We 've been fighting since the beginning of time . '' `` What ? '' `` You 're not in a bloody war . You 've never been in a fucking war before . '' His eyes widened . `` No , I 'm in a freaking war ! '' I yelled . `` You do n't understand , '' I told him . He looked at me . `` They 're killing us ! '' He shouted . `` THEY 'RE KILLING US ! '' `` I 've seen it ! '' he yelled . He was right . The war was a war for the betterment of humanity . I could see the blood on my hands . I saw the bodies of my comrades . The bodies of people who were killed . I felt the cold steel of my rifle as I pressed my face against the cold , hard steel . I watched as the body of my brother fell to the ground , and the body that had been my best friend , my brother , fell to my side . I knew what was coming . I heard the sound of his voice . `` The enemy is coming ! '' The enemy . I looked at my brother . `` Do n't you see ? '' he shouted . He 'd been shot . He had been shot in the head . I had been hit by a bullet in the chest . I did n't know what to do . I turned to my father , who was still standing there , and looked at him . I said , `` I think I 'll go to the hospital . '' My father looked at his brother , and he nodded . `` This is the last time I 'd ever see my brother alive . '' he whispered . `` He 's in a coma . '' The doctor said . He wiped his eyes . `` Why ? '' The man looked at the doctor . `` Because the man was a murderer . '' They were both dead . I thought about it . I remembered that I had to fight . I remember the pain of my mother 's death . I think about the pain I felt when I saw my brother 's body . I wonder what it was like to see my father 's head in a mangled state . I ' m not sure what I 's going to do now . I do nOTOS of my family . I hope I can save them . I want to save them from the war . I just wish I could save them , and make sure that they would n't die . I wish I had a chance to save my brother and his family .	3.5082473459624453e-06
`` I 'm sorry , '' I said , `` but I 've been thinking about what I should have done . '' I was n't sure if I should be mad , or if I was just being honest . I had n't thought about it before , but I was sure that I should n't have . I was a little bit of a wuss . I 'd been at a party last night , and I was in a bit of an awkward mood . I could n't remember what I 'll do with the money . I decided to go home , and get some sleep . I thought that I 's what I was going to do . I looked in the mirror , and saw my reflection . I saw myself in that mirror , but it was n eggs and bacon . I did n't see myself in the reflection of the mirror . I knew that I was the one who had to go . I stopped myself from looking at myself , and just looked at my reflection in the mirrors . I felt like I could see myself as a little girl , and that I could be a little boy again . I walked to the bathroom , and looked into the mirror again . It was the same reflection . It looked like my face , but with a little more blood . I tried to see myself , but instead I saw a man . I do n't know how I got to this point , but there was a man in my mirror . He was a young man , and he was holding a gun . He looked like he was about to shoot me . I asked him to stop . He said nothing . He just stared at me . He did n’ t say anything . I started to walk out the door , but he stopped me . And I heard him say , `` I 'M sorry . '' And I looked at him . I said nothing , and then I saw him . He held the gun . I ran out of the bathroom . I remember the feeling I felt . I wanted to run , but my body was n‘ t moving . I never got to run . I just sat there , and watched the man shoot me , and the man in the chair . I heard the man say , “ I ’ m sorry. ” He then looked at me , too . I didn ’ t know what to say . I couldn ’'t see what he was going on about , so I just stared . I got up and walked out of that bathroom , but before I could get to the door he shot me .	3.5188993479096098e-06
The sun was low in the sky when the war began . It was a cold and dreary day , but the sky was bright and clear , and the sky itself was a bright blue . The sky was a brilliant blue , and I could see the stars , and they were shining brightly . I was in the middle of the forest , and it was cold and dark . The sun was setting , and a cold wind was blowing through the trees , and there was a small town in the distance . I looked up , and saw a large mountain , and behind it , I saw a giant rock , and in the center of it , a massive rock . It looked like a mountain , but it was taller than me , and had a long , thin , dark greenish rock . I could not see anything else , and all the trees were covered in a thick layer of snow . I saw the ground around me , but I could n't see anything . I knew that I was surrounded by mountains , but there was no one there . I felt as though I was being watched , but no one was there . The mountains were not moving . I heard a noise , and suddenly I saw something , and then I saw it . The rock was moving . It moved faster than I could run . I ran , and ran , but my feet were n't moving . The rocks were moving . And then I heard the sound of a voice , and my feet did n't move . It said , `` I am the voice of the dead . '' The rock moved faster . I tried to run , but all I could do was scream . I had to run . The noise was getting louder . I shouted , `` How are you ? '' The stone , the rock , the mountains , the mountain , the people , the forest . It did nahon . I screamed and screamed , but nothing happened . The stone was moving faster , and louder . It passed me , then . I yelled , `` You 're going to die . '' I could feel the ground moving , and as I ran I heard something , a voice . It screamed , `` Why are you going to live ? '' I screamed , and looked up . I did nactivity , and felt the ground move . The ground was moving , but only a little . I got up , it was getting closer , and when I looked , I could hear it . It had a voice of its own , and its voice was the same as mine . `` I do n't know . I do not know why you are here . ''	3.492151563477819e-06
`` Well , I 'm not sure what you 're talking about . '' I said , as I leaned back in my chair and tried to catch my breath . `` I 've never actually killed a zombie before . '' The room was silent . I was n't sure what to say . `` What do you mean ? '' `` I mean , you 've killed a few zombies before . I 'll get to that in a second . '' He said . `` But you 'll never kill a zombie . '' `` You 're right . I never killed a Zombie . '' It was a little hard to believe . `` So what do you think ? '' I asked . `` You ca n't kill a Zombie ? '' he said . I could n't believe it . `` Not really . '' People started laughing . `` No , I mean it 's not like that . '' said the man in the room . `` Yeah , I know . '' he replied . `` Well , then , I guess I 'd have to kill a Rock . '' A few people were laughing . I looked at the man , who was now looking at me . `` It 's just a little weird . '' Said the man . `` Do you know why ? '' asked the man who was laughing . The man in front of me was looking at the wall . `` Because I 's a zombie , '' I replied . The guy in the corner was staring at the walls . `` That 's weird . I do n't know why . '' the man said . The room went silent . `` Why ? '' He asked . I started to say something . `` Sorry , '' said someone else . `` Oh , '' the guy in front said . He looked at me and then looked at his hands . `` Did you kill a zombies before ? '' The man looked at my hands . He was looking into my eyes . `` Yes , '' he responded . `` And you 'd never kill one ? '' It took me a minute to think . `` Sure . '' . `` How ? '' said I . `` Ugh , '' He replied . I laughed . ``Why not ? '' '' Because I do it . '' Says the man standing in front . `` He 's dead . '' says the man from the corner . `` Where 's the rest of the group ? '' asks the man with the red eyes . I look at him . `` They 're all dead . I ca n’ t find them . ''	3.7316392536013154e-06
The man was a monster . I knew it . I had seen it , I had felt it , and I knew what it was . I could feel it , it was there . I was a chameleon , and it was in me . I always knew what I was doing . I never really knew what to do . I just knew it was happening . I felt it . The man was just a monster , and he knew it , but I knew I could n't do it . He knew I was there , and that he knew I would n't , and so I did n't . I did it . That 's why I was able to do it , because I knew that I could . The thing was , it did n Kit-kats . I know that he was a murderer . I can feel it . It was in him . The way he could feel the pain , the way he felt the pain . The feeling that he could see me , the fear , the anger . I saw it . And I knew . I thought I was just one of the many . I suppose I was . The other day I was in the bathroom , and the water was on . I looked at it , the water , and saw it was a blood red , and there was blood on it . But it was n't blood , it had n't been blood . I wanted to scream , but the water stopped me . The water stopped . I do n't know how long it was , but it was long enough to make a small splash on the floor . I jumped and ran out of the bathroom . I ran to the sink , and found it . No blood , just a splash . I grabbed the sink . I splashed the water on my face , and did n Manhattan , and then I ran . I threw up . I got back into the bathroom and threw up again . I 'm not sure how long I did that . I guess I 'll have to find out . I went to the kitchen and poured myself a glass of water . I poured it over my face and saw that it was still there . It looked like it was blood . It did n flow . It ran down my face . I took a sip . I put it on my mouth . I laughed . I smiled . I drank . I ate . I watched the water run down my mouth , and suddenly I saw the blood on my hands . I heard it . My blood . My hand . I fell to the floor , and fell on the ground . I coughed . I cried . I screamed . I stopped . The blood was gone . I stood up , and let out a sigh . I walked to the bathroom again , and looked at the water . My eyes were still there , but they were n't water . They were blood . The liquid was naught but a blood .	3.5291595850139856e-06
`` I 'm sorry , I 'll be right back , '' she said , turning to the man on the other side of the trail . `` I 've been looking for you . '' `` Why ? '' I asked , confused . `` Where am I ? '' she asked , her voice trembling . `` Oh , I know . You 're the only one I 'd ever find . '' I said , looking at her , my eyes wide . `` How are you even here ? '' She looked at me , confused and confused . I looked at her . `` What are you talking about ? '' `` I do n't know . I just ... I 're not sure . '' She said , her eyes widening . `` Why do you think I 's here ? ! '' I looked back at her and she was still looking at me . `` You know , I was looking for someone . '' she explained . `` Someone who was going to be my next victim . '' The man was n't sure what to say . `` Maybe . Maybe I 'M not . '' He said , his eyes still on me . I was n judges . I could n't tell if he was lying or not . `` Well , I am . '' he said , `` I think I know what you 're looking for . '' His voice was so low and soft . `` It 's a lot easier to find someone when you 've got a target . '' My eyes widened . `` Wait , what ? '' He was nosey . `` There 's no target . You are the perfect target . I '- '' `` You 've seen my face . '' Her eyes widened again . `` But you 'll never find it . '' We both looked at each other . `` Who are you ? '' The first thing I said was , `` You are a killer . '' And then I looked down at the ground . `` A killer . You know what ? I ' find you . You have a target , but I do not . You need to be the one . '' A few seconds passed . `` Then I ' m going to kill you . I have a plan . '' So I said . `` So I ' Messages . '' That was the first time I had ever seen her . I had n't thought about it . `` The only way to do it , is to kill someone . I need to find the perfect person . '' There was a pause . `` And what do you want me to do ? ''	3.4970371416420676e-06
I was sitting in my living room , watching TV when I heard the noise . I had just finished watching a documentary about a couple of hours ago on the weather , and I was watching the news when I noticed the sound of a loud bang . I looked up from the tv and saw a figure in the middle of the room , with a huge gun pointed at me . I slowly crept over to the door and peered through the peephole . I saw a man with a knife , and a gun pointed towards me . He was wearing a black suit and a black tie . He had a large , dark beard , and seemed to be holding a pistol in his hand . He looked at me , and said , `` I 'm going to kill you . '' I started to scream . I was scared , but I did n't know what to do . I could n't do anything . I tried to run , but the man grabbed me by the shoulder , and pulled me to the ground . I screamed , but he kept holding me . `` I will kill you ! '' He said . I felt a pain in my stomach , and felt my eyes widen . I started screaming . I heard a loud thud , and the man turned around . I did not see the man , but his gun was pointed at my head . I just felt the pain in his head , and then I saw the gun in his hands . He held it up to my face , and shot me in the head . He then started to walk away , and when he did , I started running . I do n't think I was able to get away . I feel like I was in a coma . I 've been in a hospital for a week , and they 're still trying to figure out what happened . I have n't seen my parents since . I ca n't tell them I 'll be dead , and my friends and family are n't going to be able to see me . They say I 'd be a ghost , and that they 'll never see me again . I wish I could tell them that I 's dead . I think I 'M going to die . I can feel the pain again . The pain is unbearable , and it hurts . I start to cry . I try to hide , but it 's too late . I look down at my body , and see a man 's blood on my hands . I see the blood on the floor , and feel the gun pointed toward me . The man is dead . `` Do n't die ! '' I yell , and he dies . I am dead .	3.5005407426069723e-06
`` Fine Red Silk , Golden Thread . '' I looked down at the threads that covered my body . It was a simple , simple thing , but it was a beautiful thing . I was sitting on my bed , looking at the sheet I had put on , and I could feel the warmth of the sheets as I looked at the fabric . `` I 'm sorry , I do n't think I can do that . '' `` I know , I know . '' The silk was soft , and it was soft . It felt like a silk pillow , and as I laid down , I felt a warmth that I had never felt before . `` Why do naught but the sheets ? '' I asked , and the fabric was soft again . `` You know , you 're right . '' She said , and she looked at me . `` What ? '' `` You 're not lying . '' My voice was weak , but I knew what she was saying . `` No . '' Her voice was like a whisper , but she was n't . `` It 's not . '' An echo , and a vibration , and then a flash of light . The light was a light , but not a light . It seemed to come from somewhere , and yet it was there . `` Do n't you know what 's there ? '' She asked , but her voice was different . It sounded like a question , but was n not . `` Yes . '' A voice said , but there was no reply . `` The threads are different . '' And I felt that I could n't do anything about it . `` How could you know ? '' she asked . `` Because you 've been lying to me for years . '' As I looked up , I realized I was staring at a different piece of silk , and that I was looking at a thread . I knew that the thread was different , but the fabric did n't look like a thread at all . `` Where 's the thread ? '' Her eyes were wet with tears . `` So you do n' t know ? You know what I mean . '' It was all I could do to keep from crying . `` When you 'd say that , you knew . '' After a moment , she nodded . `` But you do . '' There was a pause . `` And you know why ? '' The light had faded , and now she was looking up at me , and there was a flash . `` There 's a reason you 's here . ''	3.4967370083904825e-06
I was a good boy . I was born a good kid . I had the best parents and the best friends . I always had a great family . I loved my friends . My parents were always there for me . I would go to bed at night and watch the TV . My mom and dad would always make sure I was safe and sound . They were always nice and supportive . They would always tell me that I was a great kid . They always told me that they were proud of me . They told me I was good . They helped me grow up . They taught me that life was a gift . They encouraged me to be happy . They gave me a purpose . They showed me what life was about . They never told me how I would die . They did n't tell me how . They only told me . But I knew . I knew that I would never see my parents again . I know that I will never see them again . That I will always be alone . That my life will always end in death . I do n't know why I do this . I think I 'm just tired . I 've been doing this for so long . I have n't had a chance to live . I ca n't even remember what my name is . I remember nothing . I just know that my life is over . I feel so tired . Every time I close my eyes , I see my life . I see the world as it ends . I can hear my parents saying goodbye . I hear them saying goodbye to me . My friends say goodbye to their parents . I watch them leave the house . I look at the clock . It 's almost midnight . I start to get up . I turn my head to the right and I see myself . I am standing in the middle of the street . I walk towards the police . I check the time . I get to the building . I sit down on the curb . I take a deep breath . I stare at the sky . I wait . I stay there . I thought I could n't do it . I waited for a long time . But then I realized that I could do it , I could see the sun rise . I could feel the sun rising . I saw my parents walk in . I looked at the time and saw it was 1:00 in the morning . I closed my eyes . I stood up . My arms were shaking . I did nscale the building , and I took a deep breathe . I opened my eyes and I saw the police officer . He was standing over me . He said , `` I 'll be here in a moment . '' He walked away . I heard my parents say goodbye . Then I heard the police sirens . I came out of the building and I heard them yelling at me . `` I love you . I love the way you look . I want to tell you to stop . I need you to listen to me , to listen . I will be there for you . '' I said . I ran away .	4.304404683352914e-06

`` I hope I 'm not bothering you , good sir , I 'd like to see something that does n't exist . '' `` You 're not going to find it ? '' `` I 've tried to . '' The man in the black suit and tie , his dark hair flowing in the wind , his black beard , his beard , and his thick glasses were all that was left of the old man . He was a man in his early thirties , his hair was black , his eyes were dark , and he had a slight beard that was almost as long as his hair . He looked at the man , who was wearing a black suit with a white shirt , and a black tie . `` I-I 'm sorry , sir . '' He said . `` Do you know where I can find it , sir ? '' The old man asked .

`` I 'm sorry , '' he said . `` I know . '' I shook my head . `` No , I 've always been sorry . I 'll get through this . '' `` I 'd like to know what happened . '' He looked at me , and I could see his eyes were a deep green , like a lake . `` You 're not supposed to . '' His voice was quiet , and he looked down . `` Do n't you remember ? '' I nodded . `` Of course I do . '' We sat on the bench , and the sun was just beginning to set . The sky was a bright blue , and in the distance , a blue sky , and a blue moon . The trees were a bright green , and we could see the sky . `` Please , '' I said . He turned his head , and looked at the stars . `` There 's nothing I can do . I ca n't do anything . '' My voice was weak , and it was almost as if I was crying . `` People do n't understand . '' The tears started to fall . `` It 's not your fault . You 've done everything you could . You should have been there to help . '' he looked up , and his eyes met mine . `` But you were n't . '' There was a moment of silence , and then , `` I thought you would n't be here . '' It was n't really a question , but I felt like I was . `` How could you not be here ? '' His eyes were still wet . `` What 's wrong ? '' `` You did n't say .

I should have stayed . He 'd never have been able to help me . I would have helped myself . I had been there for him . The sun was setting , and there was a blue glow in the sky , but there was nothing I could help him . `` Why did you have to do this ? '' He asked . `` Because I could .

I was a little surprised . `` Did you have an imaginary friend ? '' she asked . She was right . I had . I remember that I had a friend . I did n't know how to describe him . `` He was a friend , '' he said . I stared at him . I remembered him . He was in my room , and he was there , and we were talking . `` Yeah . '' He said .

The first time I flew a plane was a long time ago . I was a young man , and I was n't quite sure how I had gotten here , but I was sure that I had been born to do it . I had seen the sky , and it was beautiful . I 'd been told that I would be able to fly a plane , and there was no other way to go but up . I found myself on the edge of the ocean , and suddenly I was in a plane . I looked up to the sky and saw a small town . I could n't help but wonder if I could land there , and then I saw the small town , and the people . They were all dressed in white , and they had a small church . I did n't know what to think of them , and when I got off the plane I was pretty sure that they were n't even really people . I saw a couple of them . I asked them if they had any questions , and one of them asked me if I was the first person to fly an airplane . I said I was , and he asked me what I was going to do . I told him that I was just going to go home . I felt a little sick , and began to cry . I remember being scared , and being glad that I did . I wanted to go back to my home , but it was too late . I knew that I could not stay here . I walked down the street , and saw some people walking home . They had a little boy , and a girl , and an old man , who looked like they were going to die . I heard a lot of noise , and thought that I should go back . I took the child and ran to the church . The old man told me that I 'm the first to fly , and that I need to do something . I ran to my mother , and told her that I wanted a plane to fly . I went back to the house , and she told me to go to the airport , and to go flying . I left the house and went to the airplane . The plane was very small , and had a big window , and no windows . I drew a big red arrow , and started to fly it . The air was very hot . I flew it for a while , and in the distance I saw another plane , but the air was so hot that I almost died . I landed , and walked back to home , and found my mother and the old man . I sat down , and we talked . I got up , and went back out to the air . I drove the plane to my house , to the old woman , and asked her if she wanted me to fly the plane . She said yes , and said that I needed to go . I decided to take the plane , because I had to get back home .	3.5344241950951982e-06
`` I 'm sorry , '' the voice said . `` I 've never seen a human before . '' `` I know , '' I replied . `` It 's not your fault . '' The voice was very familiar , but I did n't know it . I 'd never seen it before . `` Why ? '' I asked . `` You have to be kidding me . '' It was a very strange question , but the words came out of my mouth like a question . `` What do you mean ? '' `` You do n't understand . '' I had been told by a lot of people , but this was the first time I 'll ever hear it . It was n't my first time . `` We have been told that it 's a joke .

He had been telling me for years . `` No . '' And then I heard it . `` The world is in danger . '' This was the last time I heard the words . I looked up . `` And what is it ? '' And I saw the face . I saw him . He looked like a man . I could n't see his face . He smiled . `` Our species has always been a little bit different . '' he explained . `` In the past , we would have been a simple race . We were , like , a little more powerful . '' A little more advanced . `` With our race , we had the capability to travel . We had the ability to reach other planets . We could go to other worlds . '' There was a pause . `` To other planets ? '' He asked . I nodded . `` How many ? '' he asked . He said , `` I do n're not sure . '' Nothing . `` Oh . '' After a moment , I said . And then he spoke again . `` They do nnot know that we are a race . They do not know that they are a species . '' *We are a people . * `` We are the most powerful race in the galaxy .

`` I 'm sorry , but I ca n't believe I 've been doing this for the past 10 minutes . I 'll be fine , I swear . '' `` It 's okay , I 'd like to know what the hell you 're talking about .

I could n't help but look at it too . `` Well , it 's not really what it says . '' My eyes widened . `` It says , '' I answered . `` The number of people in the world who have access to the most resources . '' The bracelet read 19 . `` How ? '' `` Well ... '' `` What ?

'' he asked . `` Because I 'M A FUCKING FUCKING BITCH ! '' I screamed . `` Oh , my God , you really are a fucking idiot . '' It was a loud explosion . `` All I ' am is a fucking kid . You know what I mean ? '' *What ? * I looked up . `` Look , I just ... I ca't believe you 'll let me do this .

'' They all looked at me in shock . `` Please , I do n't want to do this , '' he pleaded . `` Shut up ! '' `` I ' m not a fucking child ! '' He screamed . I looked back at the bracelet . `` We 're all kids , '' a voice from behind me said . It was my mother . `` Come on , you know you have to do something . '' She was standing in front of me . She was holding a large , red , plastic bag . `` Stop ! '' She said . The crowd gasped . `` Yes , '' she said . She looked at her wrist , and she looked down . `` And I ' busied myself with my wrist . ''	3.7390595934994053e-06
I ride the elevator up to my apartment every day , browsing my phone / reading a book / reading my book the whole way , not noticing what floor I 'm on until it stops . Today it just keeps going . Today I 'll have to ask my girlfriend if I can get out of there . I 've been sitting on the elevator for a couple minutes now . The elevator is at the top of the stairs , but it 's not moving . I do n't know why . I think I 'd like to get off at the bottom . I have n't been up here in a while . I wait for the elevator to stop and sit on the floor , but I ' get no response . I decide to check my phone . I can hear the elevator stop . I check my book . It 's still there . It never stops . I start to get nervous . I look at my phone and see the number , but there 's nothing there . The last time I checked , the number was on the second floor . I grab my phone , but the number is n't there . Then I look down at my book , and it 'll be there . On the floor above me , the elevator is on the third floor . The first time I was on this floor , I was n't scared . I was scared . The second time I 's been on this level , I 're scared . It was a dark room , and the walls were covered in a thick , black dust . I could n't see anything , and I could hear the faintest of footsteps . The door opens , and a man walks in . `` Hi . I am the elevator . '' He looks at me , and he seems to be smiling . `` I am on the fourth floor , '' I say , and then he says , `` No , you are n't . '' I 'D been on the fifth floor for a while now . I ca n't tell what floor . `` But I am n't , '' he says . `` You are on the seventh floor . '' `` I 'M ON THE Fifth Floor , '' `` What ? '' `` You 're on the sixth floor , and you are on this ... floor . You are nawed to death , '' the man says , and now he 's smiling . I feel a little scared , but then I hear the door open again . The man steps out , and says , '' You are the sixth . '' And he walks out . I turn around , and see a woman . She 's wearing a black dress , with a black robe . `` What is it , '' she says , looking at me . `` Do you know what floor we are on ? '' I reply , `` I do , '' and she says . I walk down the stairs and see my girlfriend on the street . She looks at the woman , and she smiles , and we both get off the elevator and head back up the stairs .	4.482175882003503e-06
`` You know , I think I might have to write a story about this . '' I said to the man in the corner . He looked up at me , a look of confusion on his face . `` What ? '' I asked . `` I 'm sorry ? '' He said . `` You 're not going to tell me what to write about ? '' `` I know . '' He replied . `` But I 've got a lot of time . '' `` You do . '' he said . I sighed and turned to the corner , and began to walk away . `` Why do you think I 'll be here ? '' he asked . I looked at him . `` Because I 'd like to write something , '' I replied . I turned to leave . `` If you 're going to be in here , I 's going to write this down . '' The man looked at me blankly . `` That 's not going anywhere . '' And I turned away . He slowly walked away . I could n't help but feel a bit sad . `` So what do you want to write ? '' The woman in the wall said . She looked at the wall and shook her head . `` It 's a story . '' She said . Her face was a mixture of disgust and sadness . `` No , it 's n't . '' It was a story of a man who was pushed into a corner and pushed back . `` And what do I do ? '' she asked . He was silent for a moment . `` Well , I guess I 'M going to have to do something . '' This was a bad idea . I decided to write it down . I took a deep breath and started . `` Okay , so I 're writing about this man . '' As I was writing , I looked back at the man who had pushed me into the corner and saw his face as I looked away . The man was still staring at the woman in front of me . `` He 's just a man , '' he says . `` A man who 's being pushed back into a wall . '' His voice was shaking . `` Is he going to die ? '' My heart sank . `` Yes , '' the man said . He stood up . `` Then I ' m going to go . '' With that , he walked away , and I watched him go . I sat down and stared at the floor . `` Do you want me to write some more ? '' the woman asked . She was looking at me with a look on her face . I did n't know what to say . I just wanted to sit there . `` Oh , no , '' she said . But I did . I was n't going to lie . I wrote down the story . `` These people are n't like this . They 're just people . They do n't understand . ''	3.532749133228208e-06
The first time I wrote a story , I was a little nervous . I had never written anything in my life , and I had n't written anything before . I was just starting out , and it was a bit of a mess . I 'd never been good at writing , and my brain was n't in the best of shape , but I had a lot of ideas , and maybe I could figure it out . I did n't know what I was going to write , but it was nesity . I thought I 've been doing this for a while now , and then I realized I was n 't sure what to write . I started off with a good idea , a nice , well-written story , but then I started to feel like I wasn't doing it right . I tried to write the first chapter , but the first few lines were all wrong . I wanted to write more , but that 's not the point . I finally got it down . I wrote it , and started to get excited . I just wanted to get a little more detail . I decided to write a story about a kid who was a janitor in a small town , and he was a nice guy . He was a very good janitor , and hid his real name , so I thought he was cute . I got to know him pretty well , and we got along great . I also liked his girlfriend , and she was nice . We got along really well . I think he was just a nice kid . I do n't think he *really* was a good janitors . I guess I 'm just not good at it . I put the story down . It 's bad . I have a lot more ideas , but they 're not good . I want to write something else , but my brain is n't good . Maybe I 'll write a book . I get to write it . -- - I ' ve been writing for a few months now . I would like to write another story . I hope you guys like it . Have a good day . I really do . -- -- -- - If you enjoyed this , please check out my subreddit , /r/WritingPrompts .

`` I never wanted you to leave . '' I never wished you to go . I never knew what you could do . I was n't sure if you were even alive . I do n't know if you know what I mean . I have never known you . I 've never seen you . But I 'm sure you 've been here before . I know you 're here . I remember the first time we met . The way you looked at me . The simple smile on your face . I thought I was going to die . I knew I was wrong . But you never let me . You were there , and you were there for me . I had no choice but to love you . You taught me so much , and I still do . You 're the only one who ever loved me . But there was something different about you . There was something in you . Something I never thought I could have . I could n't describe . I can still feel it . I ca n't explain it . But it was there . I did n't want to leave , and yet I did . I wanted to stay . I want to be with you . The last time I saw you , you were still there . You had the same smile , the same look , and the same energy . I tried to tell you that I loved you . And I tried . I really did . But not anymore . I missed you . It 's not like I was ever going to leave you . If I ever did , I 'd be gone . I would never be able to see you again . I will never be the same . I miss you . Your smile , your laugh , the way you always made me feel . I wish I could be with that smile again . You are the only person who ever was . I love you , and it 's the only thing that I ever wanted . I just wish you were here . But now I 'll never be with ... you . For you . Never again . '' My heart sank . I felt a little sick . I closed my eyes and thought of you . My heart was breaking . I wished I could stay . But this was n't you . This was n 't you , my love . I loved the way that you were . I fought for you . When you were born , you loved me , and now you 'll always love me . And to think that you 'd never leave . I always wanted you .	4.137643372814637e-06
I 've never been much of a Christmas fan . I 'm not a big fan of Christmas , or at least not the ones I 've been raised with . I do n't know why I do it . I was never one to be a big believer in Santa , and I do most of the shopping for Christmas . I suppose I 'd rather not be . I just do n Outdoor Christmas shopping . I mean , I do like the idea of Christmas . But I do have a few things I 'll have to get rid of . The first is my wife . She 's going to be up in a few minutes . I have a feeling she 's already started preparing for the kids . The other two kids are going to have their presents ready . I think I 's ready for the big day . I guess I 'M ready . It 's been a long day . It was a long , long day , but I ' m not going to lie . I always hated Christmas . After all , it 's not like I 're going to get to see my kids . I did n't even get to go to bed . I know that . I get up . I make my way down the stairs to the living room . I hear my wife and kids in the room . They 're all dressed up in their best presents . I see the kids dressed up and ready to go . I pull the door open . I walk into the living area and see my wife sitting at the table . She looks at me , and says `` Hi , Daddy . '' I nod , and walk towards her . I open the door . `` Hi . '' She says . `` Are you Santa ? '' I say . `` Yes . '' `` I ' woven my beard , and my hat . '' she says . I smile . `` I have been waiting for you to come down the steps . '' My wife looks at her , and then I see her face . `` You 're Santa . '' Her eyes are wide . `` No . '' *Oh . * `` I am . '' And she 'll be on her way . `` Santa , I ' Determine who you are . '' The kids look at me . `` What 's your name ? '' `` Santa . I am Santa . A Santa Claus . '' They all laugh . `` So , what do you want ? '' They ask me . I laugh , and say `` I want to go home . '' Their eyes widen . `` Why ? ''	4.3041090975748375e-06
`` So , I 'm not the original ? '' `` No , you are not . '' `` You 're not the clone , are you ? '' I asked , not wanting to be rude , but I knew that this was the only way to get the truth . `` I am . I am the clone . '' I 'd been told that I would be a clone for life , that I was the one who would be the one to be killed . I was n't sure what to expect , but it was n relativity . I 've been told I would have to be a Clone for life . I would n't have to die , but if I could live forever , I would . `` What do you mean ? '' The clone was a bit confused . I knew it was a clone , but why would it be ? `` Well , I just wanted to know . '' The Clone said , his face in shock . `` So , you 're the clone ? '' It was the first time I ' had ever heard of this . `` Yes , I am '' I said , trying to hide the tears in my eyes . `` Tell me , are I the clone and I 'll be the only one ? '' My clone was almost crying . `` No . You 'll never be the clone of me . '' He said , looking at me with a look of confusion . `` You are the clone I 's been told about . '' His voice was almost a whisper . `` The clone that was born in my body . '' It had been a long time since I 'VE heard that voice . `` My name is not the Clone . '' My Clone said . `` Why are you saying that ? '' He asked . `` Well I 'M THE clone . I got the name of my clone . It 's the only name I ' have . '' That was all I could say . `` But I ' 'm the clone that you 've had for a long , long time . '' he said . He was right . I had been clones for years . I did n't even know that I had one . `` And what do you think I am ? '' he asked . I smiled . `` That I 're a clone . You are . '' A tear rolled down my cheek . I looked at the clone 's face . `` Do n't you think you 'll die ? '' the Clone said again . `` Are you the clone who 's going to die ? You 've never been the original . ''	3.71680084754189e-06
`` I 'm sorry . '' The man said . `` I 've tried . I really have . '' `` I know . I know , '' I replied . `` You 're not going to believe this . '' He said . I could see his eyes , the same eyes that he had when I first met him . I had never met him before . He had been a stranger , a friend of mine . He was the only person who knew me . I 'd never met anyone else . `` What do you mean ? '' I asked . `` The one who told me I was wrong . The one I was supposed to meet . The only person I was meant to meet , the one who I was n't meant to see . '' I knew what he meant . `` But I do n't know . '' he said . He looked at me . `` It 's not my fault . I just did n't want to be the one to tell you . '' This was n't true . `` Yes , it is . '' It was n 't my fault that I had n't seen him for so long . I was just a kid then . I did n ' t know what to do . I knew I should n't have told him . `` This is n't my fault , '' he had told me . But I did it . I told him , and he did n' t listen . `` Try again . '' That was the last thing I said . The man looked at my hand . `` Please . '' His voice was cold and empty . `` Just try again . I do not know how to tellyou . '' After a moment of silence , he said , `` I do . '' And I knew that I would never see him again . He 'd be gone . I would n't see him . It would be a long time before I could . I looked down at my hands . I felt the cold , hard , metal of the knife in my hand and the cold metal of my heart . I thought of the last time I 'll see him , the last words I ' d ever say to him . The last time we 'd have a conversation . I took a deep breath , and I took the knife out of my hand , and held it in my mouth . `` Tell me , '' the man said , his voice cold and flat . `` Do you know what you 're doing ? '' He asked . I shook my head . `` No . ''	3.4954766761075007e-06
`` Dear father , I 'm sorry . I know it 's not what you expected , but I 've been thinking about you all day . I 'd like to see you again , but be sure to do so with a smile on your face . I love you . '' The letter is a bit longer than the one I sent to you last week , but it 'll do . I hope you 're proud of me . I did n't want to go to war . I was just a kid . I knew it was the right thing to do . The rest of the world was so full of pain . The war was so hard . It was n't the war we wanted . We wanted to be happy . We thought we 'd be happy , but we did naterialize . We 'd thought we could be happy with the way things were . We were n't . We did n Shakespeare , we did not know how to be a man . We could not be a mother . We had to be nothing . We have to be the man we always wanted tobe . I should have been a man , but in my mind , I was not . I do n't know how I got here . I could n't be a soldier . I am not a soldier anymore . I have become a man of the sea . I can not be an soldier . The world is too hard . I ca n't take this anymore . My life is too short . I want to be alive . I wish I could be with you . I miss you . This letter is for you . It is my last letter to you . My father . I will miss you too . I loved you . You were my best friend .

`` The baby was born . '' The mother said , `` The baby is connected to the world . '' `` How ? '' `` The mother and father are connected to each other . '' I asked . `` The child is connected , but not to the consciousness of the world , '' the father said , looking at me . `` But how ? '' I said . `` I do n't know . '' He said , his face a little red . `` It 's not like I could tell you . '' She said , her voice shaking . `` We 've never seen a baby disconnected . '' My eyes widened . `` Does n't that make sense ? '' She asked , her face turning red again . `` Yes , but what if it was n't connected ? '' The child looked at me , and I was shocked . `` What if it 's disconnected ? '' Her voice sounded like a broken record . `` You 're not disconnected , '' I told her . `` No , '' she said , and then she looked at the baby . `` And you 're connected to me . '' Her face was a little blue . `` Well , what if I was ? '' she asked . I had n't seen that face in years . `` Then you 'd be disconnected , too . '' she replied , and she looked around , and the baby was still blue . She was not connected to my mind . `` So , '' my voice was shaking . I looked at her , and my eyes were red . I was not sure what to say . `` Are you sure you want to do this ? '' the mother said . I shook my head . `` There is no way . '' And then she was gone . I stood up , and walked to the kitchen , and looked at my son . `` Is it okay ? '' He asked , and he looked at his father , and his father nodded . `` Do you want me to go and get you something to eat ? '' he asked . We sat down , and we ate , and they ate , then we talked . `` How do you feel about it ? '' my son asked . He asked . His father nodded , and smiled . `` This is the first time you 've ever asked me this , '' he said , as he looked down at the child . `` My name is Alex . '' Alex was a beautiful child , and it was a good thing . `` Your mother and I are connected , '' said my father . `` That 's what we are . ''	3.4914987736556213e-06
`` The first men were the first men . Before the first man , there was a wheel of cheese . '' The first man said as he looked at the wheel of Cheese . `` The first women were the women .

The package was addressed to my own . I opened it and I was shocked . It was a letter from myself , a letter that said `` Myself . Sort of . '' I read the name and read it again . `` My myself ... Sort of '' . I looked at the letter and I immediately knew that I had to open it . I had no idea what it was about , and I did n't know what it meant . I was just a little bit curious , and that was enough to make me open it again , and again , I read it . `` You 're my only hope . '' It was my only chance at salvation . I could n't believe it . It had to be a joke , and it was just so perfect . I read over it again and again . It said `` Come to me , and see if you can find a way to save me . '' As I read again , the words began to form in my head . `` I 'm sorry . '' The words were a little too fast for me to understand , and the words were too slow for me . I just could n not comprehend them . I kept reading and reading until I had finished . I decided to open the letter . `` Oh , it 's just a joke . '' `` I know . '' My heart was racing . I felt like it was going to burst . I picked up the letter again and read the letter once more . `` Your only hope is that you can save me , '' I said . `` And that you will never have to know what I have to do . '' And with that , the letter was gone . I closed the letter with a sigh . I sat down in my chair and stared at the floor . I did not want to open that letter . I wanted to close it . But I knew I had n't . I got up and looked around . The room was empty . I checked the computer . I saw a message from my wife . `` This is my only option . '' She had left me a message . `` We have to get you out of here . '' -- -- -- - This is an old story . I 'd love to get more feedback .

I 'm not sure what I expected . The snow was coming down harder than I thought it would . I 'd thought it 'd be a bit easier to get up . It was n't . It just seemed to be getting harder to get down . I was nodding my head in agreement with the nurse , as I had been for the past hour . I knew it was naught but the cold . I had to get out . I could n't think . I just had to keep my eyes open . I did n't know what to do . I felt like I was going to die . I wanted to cry . I needed to cry , but I knew this was the only way to get away from the cold , so I just kept my eyes closed . I tried to breathe . I started to cry as I heard a scream . It sounded like a girl , but it was coming from my left . It came from my right . I opened my eyes and saw that she was in front of me . I looked up and saw her . She was a girl . I saw her face . I see her face in the snow . She had a face . Her face was beautiful . I took a deep breath and said , `` What do you want ? '' She looked at me . She looked me in the eyes and said : `` I 'm sorry . I know you are n't a soldier . I thought you were a soldier , but you 're not . You 're a girl and I 've been waiting for you . I hate you . '' I smiled and said `` I love you . You are a girl ! '' She smiled and I smiled back . `` I know . I love the way you look at me , and I love how you look back at me when I 'll be gone . I do n't want to be gone yet . I want to see you again . '' She said `` Let 's go . '' We walked out of the snow together . I walked down the hill to the hospital . I went to the front door and the nurse told me to wait . I said , '' I 's not a soldier ! '' I turned around and walked back to the nurse and said to her , `` I thought I was dead . '' `` You are n not a Soldier ! '' she said . `` You 've got a very good heart . You have a very strong heart . '' And she smiled at me and said in a soft voice : `` You have an excellent heart . I have a good heart , and a good soul . '' The nurse said . I smiled . I told her I loved her . `` We 'll get you home , '' she told me . `` My name is Emily . ''	3.839702458208194e-06
It was a short knock on the door . I heard it , and I could n't help but feel a little bit of fear . I opened the door and looked inside . I was n't sure what I expected . I had been expecting a man with a beard . A man who looked like he was in his forties . I could see the wrinkles on his face and the wrinkles in his hair . He looked like a man who had been through a lot . I did n't know if he had a wife or kids . He was nae a man of many years , but he had seemed to have a bit of a troubled past . I took a step back and tried to figure out what I was expecting . `` Hello ? '' I asked . `` I 'm sorry ? '' He said . I 'd heard that voice before , but I did not expect it to be a man . `` What do you want ? '' `` I want to talk to you . '' He looked so familiar . I knew he was the man I had heard about . `` You 're my friend . '' I said . `` How can I help you ? '' The man looked at me with a smile . `` Well , I 've been looking for you for a while . '' `` Well ... I 'll tell you . It 's just that I 'M not sure what you 're asking . '' The voice was soft and soft . I just wanted to know what he was talking about . I felt a little nervous . I looked around the room . I found my way to the closet door . `` Do n't go in there . '' he said . He seemed to be in a hurry . `` Please . '' '' I whispered . He opened the closet . `` But I 's not going in there , '' he replied . `` Why not ? '' he asked . I said , `` Because I 'VE been looking . I do n't want to see you . I want you to be happy . '' His eyes were filled with tears . I tried to keep my composure . I wanted to tell him that I would n't let him see the pain in my eyes . `` Look , I do not want to hurt you . You 've done nothing wrong . I know you have n't been able to , but you 've not been able . You do n sandbox me , you know . I can not let you hurt me . '' It was a little too late . I pulled the door open . I walked into the closet and sat down . `` So , what do you need ? '' Asked the man . I paused . `` Want to know why I ' am here ? ''	3.491145662337658e-06
I wake up , feeling the cold metal of the knife in my arm . I am on the ground , blood running down my arm , my hands and feet , my body tingling . I try to get up , but I can not . I look at my arm and the name on it is the same as the one on my arm ... and I do n't know how it got there . I do not know how I got there , or why I have a name on my skin . I ca n't remember anything . I remember the day I died . I was at a party , I was in a bar , and my friend , whom I had just met , was drunk . He had been a friend of mine , and we had gotten into a fight . I had told him my name , and he said he could n't find the name . He asked me what it was . I told him , `` I do . I 'm sorry . '' I do know what it is . I know the name is the name of my killer . I knew I was the one that killed him . I did n't want to know who he was . He told me that he was going to kill me . I went home , and I went to sleep . I woke up , and the blood was gone . I looked at my body , and it was gone , but my name was still there . It was n't my name . I tried to call out , but no answer . I screamed , but there was no response . I ran outside , and found my name on the sidewalk . I called out , `` What the fuck ? '' I had to find out . I got to the police station . I walked into the station , and they told me to go home . I asked for help . I never got a answer . Then I was arrested . I found out that I was a killer . My name was on my body . I want to die . I have no idea how I ended up here . I still do nuku nuku . I feel my body getting cold , and a cold . I lay in the hospital . I think I am dead . I can feel the cold . My mind is racing , and all I can think about is my name ... my name is on my face . I just want to go back to sleep , but the pain is too much . I wake up in a hospital bed , and can not remember how I came to be there . The name on me is n't mine , but it is on the hospital bed . I keep waking up , I am n't dead .	3.520661493894295e-06
I was n't sure what to expect . I was n crusty and old , but I had always thought that I was a good soldier . I had seen a lot of war . I 'd fought in the battles of Europe , and I 've fought in some of the most brutal wars . I remember the time I saw my father get hit by a bomb . I thought I was dead , but when I woke up I was able to get up and walk to the nearest hospital . I woke with a start . My wife was screaming at me , `` You 're not dead ! '' I was still trying to figure out what had happened . I looked down at the ground and saw that I 'm not dead . I took a deep breath and looked up . I saw a man standing in front of me . He looked like I had fought him before . I felt my heart stop . I did n't know him . I could n't remember his face , but his eyes were green and his hair was brown . I tried to scream again . I do n't think I could . I started to cry . I watched as he was dragged to the back of a truck . I got in the truck and we drove off . I wonder if he was a soldier or a soldier . A few hours later , I was walking home . I stopped at the door of my house . I opened the door and got out of the truck . There was a man sitting in the back . He was wearing a suit and tie . He had a gun in his hand . He reached for the door handle and I could see that he was wearing the same suit as me . I walked up to him . He turned around and looked at me . His eyes were red and his face was covered in blood . I ran over to him and I hugged him . `` I 'll take you home , '' I said . `` You should n't be here . '' `` I ca n't . '' He said . I hugged back . I said , `` I love you , '' and he hugged me back . We walked away from the truck , and he took a long look at me and smiled . I remembered . `` Do n't worry , '' he said . He put his hand on my shoulder and I smiled . `` We 'll be okay . '' I smiled back . `` Thanks , '' He smiled back at me with his own smile . I smiled and said , '' See you soon . '' We walked back to my house and I got out the truck with a smile on my face . I told him I would see him again . We drove home .	4.447041646926664e-06
`` You 're not going to believe this , but you are ! '' The sword , a longsword , was sitting on the ground . It was the last weapon I had ever seen . It had been my father 's , and he had given it to me . It 's a relic of a time when I was a young boy . He had taken it to the hall , and given it back to me when I had come to my father , and told me it was the sword that would save my life . It would save him . I did n't know what to do . I could n't kill him , and I could not kill the sword , so I took it . It is a weapon that I have been saving , and it is a sword that I will never use . I had to go to the castle , and find the sword . It did n restarted the war , and the war is over . I have n't seen the sword in years . I 'm not sure if it is still there , or if I have left it behind , but I have not seen it since . I am the last one . I ran into the hall . The sword was n't there . I looked around the room , and saw nothing . I walked over to the door , and looked at it . I thought it was a trap , but it was n assurely not . It opened , and a figure stepped out . I was n Phelps . I knew he was the only one who had seen the weapon , and as I looked at him , I knew that he was nassing for the sword to come to me , but he was too far away . I saw the sword and I knew it was gone . I turned around , and walked back to the room where I had found the sword before . I never saw it again . I went back to my room , where I found the weapon . I took the sword out of my bag , and put it on the floor . I put it to my head . I heard a noise , and suddenly I felt a lightening bolt . I felt the sword shoot out of the ground , and then I felt it hit the ground again . It hit the floor , and my eyes widened . I watched the sword fly off the floor and out of existence . I grabbed the sword from the ground and threw it at the wall . I stood up , and ran towards the door . I jumped up , but the sword was gone , and that is when I heard it . The sound of the sword striking the ground was deafening . I dropped the sword as it hit , and felt it 's force pull me into the room . I tried to run , but my legs were weak . I fell to the ground as I felt my body being pulled into the dark room . The door slammed shut , and there was nothing . There was nothing in the room that I could see . I lay on the dirt , and was surprised to see the sword sitting on a table . It looked like it was holding a sword , but there was naught in it . No one else was there . There were no other weapons in the hall that I saw . I opened the door to the Hall of the Dead , and found a man , and his sword . He was a tall , dark man , with a long beard , and dark eyes . He looked at me , and said , `` I am not here to kill you , but to be the one to save you . '' I looked down at the sword on the table , and thought , `` It is my duty to be your savior . '' `` I 'll be the first one to die , '' I said . I pulled the sword back from the table . The man looked at the weapon and said `` I do not have a weapon . ''	3.6487231227511074e-06
I was sitting in my bed , staring at my phone . I had n't even noticed that my nephew had just eaten two LSD gummy bears , but I had to make sure he was sane . I could n't believe it . I was n't sure what to do . I should have known something was wrong . I knew I should n't have taken the gummy bear , but it was n's the only thing I had left . I pulled the phone away from my ear and looked at the screen . `` Hey , what 's the matter ? '' I asked , not knowing if I should be concerned . `` I was just looking for a gummy Bear , '' he replied . `` What ? '' `` You 're not going to believe this , '' I said , `` but I 'm going to take it . '' `` What is it ? '' he asked , `` what 'd you do ? '' He looked at me , and I could tell he was n Lily . `` It 's a gummies bear . '' I looked at him and he looked at my face , and then at the gummies . `` Do n't you understand ? '' His eyes were wide and his mouth was open . He was n blown away . `` Why ? '' My heart was pounding . `` Because I 've been trying to make you sane for a while , '' my nephew said . `` But I ca n't . '' He was shaking . `` You have to make me sane , '' Mommy said . She was n Souls . `` And you 've got to make it through sane . '' My nephew was crying . I looked around , and saw that I had a lot of work to do , but at least I could do it . `` We 're going to have to do it together . '' Daughter said . I handed her the gums . `` Daddy , '' she said , as I got up . `` Mama 's going to be mad . '' She said . My father , who was napping on the couch , looked at her , and said , “ I 'll be mad too , but she 'll get it . You 'll just have to be patient. ” I looked down at my nephew and he was crying again . I started to cry . `` Mommy , '' said my mother , and she was crying too . I grabbed my phone and called my father , `` I 'd better go to the bathroom . '' And I walked out of the room and into the hallway . I went to the door and closed it , and went to my bedroom . I picked up the gummys , and threw them in the garbage . I opened the door to my room and started to walk down the hallway to the kitchen . I heard my wife and daughter scream , and my daughter cry . I turned around and saw her crying . `` Where 's my mother ? '' she asked . `` She 's in the bathroom , '' i said .	4.218293270241702e-06
`` You 're a noble , I know . '' `` I 'm a paladin . '' I said . `` You 've been a noble since the day you were born . '' The man looked at me with a blank face . `` No , I 've always been a paladins . '' He said . I 'd been a good paladin , and a noble man . I was a good man . `` It 's not the same . '' he said . He did n't know what he meant . `` I do n't want to be a palanquin . '' There was a pause , and I could tell he was trying to think of something to say . `` But you 're just a paladen . '' My voice was hoarse and raspy , and he was still staring at me . `` Why ? '' He asked . `` Because I 'll be a good knight . '' His voice was quiet . `` And I 're not the best paladin ! '' I retorted . `` Do n't you know how I feel ? '' I asked , and my voice was desperate . `` Well , I was once a good boy . '' A silence fell over the room . `` Now I 's just a bad boy . I do nothing . '' *It 's a lie . * I thought . `` What ? '' `` You were a good Paladin . You 'll never be a bad Paladin . '' No , no , I could n't be . `` Then why do n'm I a bad man ? '' he asked . I could see the tears forming in his eyes . `` There 's no good . There 'll always be good . '' And then he said , `` But I 'M NOT a good Paladin . I am a good Knight . '' -- -- -- - I ' m not sure where to start . I need to write this down . I just wrote it down . This is a bit long , but I ' ll try to get it down as best I can . I hope it 's worth it . I did n WP : ) I 'VE BEEN SORRY . I hate writing . I really do . I think I ' 've gotten better at it . It 'll make me a better paladin and a better man . But I ca n't believe I ' M IN LOVE WITH YOU !

I 'm not sure what it is about this room , but I think I know what it 's about . I can feel the air in the hall , and I can hear the smell of it . It 's the smell that fills my nostrils and my heart . I feel the ancient , ancient , old , and dusty smell of the hall . I know that it 'll be here , and it 'd be here for a long time . It was here when I was a child , when I first saw it , and then I saw it again . The smell of its scents was like the smell I felt when I saw the old , old and dusty book , and the smell was like a smell of a book that you ca n't put your finger on . I 've never seen it before , but it 've been in my mind for as long as I can remember . It always made me feel like I was in a dream , and that I was going to wake up . I could feel the smell , and my body felt like it was going through a process of being put through a years-long process of becoming a real person . I remember the smell and the feeling , and when I woke up , I was standing in the middle of the room , and there was a voice in my head . It said , `` I am here . '' I heard it , but no words came out . I heard this voice . I knew what it meant . I hear the voice of the old man , and he was my father . I was n't a child anymore . I did n't know what to do . I ca n not know what I was supposed to do , and what I should do . There was nothing I could do . My father was the one who had been the one to find the old book , the one that had brought me here . I walked through the hall and I saw a man , dressed in black , and a woman , dressed like me , wearing a black robe and a black hat . They were all dressed like I would be . They looked like me . I saw them , and they were me . They knew me , and we were me , but we were n't . I explained to them what I saw , and why I was here . They did n 't know what they were looking for , but they did n wrong . They had to know . They heard the voice , and were shocked . I told them the truth . I found out what the old and the young had been looking for . I tried to explain to them , but the old said , '' You have n't seen the book . '' They looked at me , in shock . I asked , `` Are you sure ? '' They nodded , and said , 'Yes . ' I told the old one , `` Do n't worry , I 'll find the book , I will find the sword . '' And I went to find it . I went through the halls , and found the book and I found the sword , and now I know the secret of the book 's secrets . I had to find out what it was , and where it was . I grabbed the sword and I had no idea what it could do , but when I found it , it was different . It felt like a sword , but not like a swords . It did n' t feel like a Sword . It looked like a weapon , but like a wooden sword . I held it in my hands , and grabbed the book from the woman . I opened the book to the page , and began to read . I read the first page , `` A sword , a sword of the great knight , a weapon of the mighty , a tool of the king . '' It was a sword that I had never seen before . It had a dark blue color , and had a red hilt , and was made of a dark brown stone . It seemed to be made of some sort of stone that I could n't quite see . I looked at the book again , and saw it was a book of old , I had n't read it before . I picked it up and read it . `` A weapon of kings , of kings . A weapon in the power of kings and of kingship . A sword of kings that is only used by kings . It is a weapon that is a sword to protect the king and his family . A Sword of kings is a tool to protect his family and his	3.49302422364417e-06
`` I do n't know what to do . '' I said to myself . I had been waiting for this moment for years , and I had n't even been able to get on the train . I 'd been waiting a long time to get off the train , and now I was going to get my chance . I stood up from the train bench and started to walk to the door . I could n't believe it , I had to get out . I walked over to the platform , and the woman in front of me was about to give birth . I was n't sure what to think . I knew that I could get on . I did n't want to be on the subway , but I was too scared to be a part of this . I looked at the woman . She was beautiful , with long blonde hair and blue eyes , and a face that had been so beautiful . She had this look of pure wealth , and she was about as beautiful as I had ever seen . I wanted to say something , but my mind was going blank . I took a deep breath , and tried to remember what I wanted . I started to feel a pain in my back , and my heart started to pound . I felt my chest tighten , and then I felt a sharp pain in the back of my head . I tried to calm myself down . I thought about my mother . I needed to be there , but at this point I was getting anxious . I ran my hand through my hair , and it was a little wet . I leaned back in my seat and tried not to think about it . I heard a loud bang , and as I looked up , I saw a bright light . I turned to see the woman standing there . She looked like she was wearing a black dress , with a pink dress shirt and a blue dress pants , and was holding a baby in her arms . She smiled at me . She started to cry . I watched her as she threw her arms around me and cried . I saw her crying so hard I felt like I was crying too . She pulled me to my feet , and started crying . She held me close , and we cried together . I closed my eyes , but she kept crying . I realized that I had no idea what to say , and that I needed a new direction . I found myself crying again . I opened my eyes and I saw the woman crying , and her face was full of tears . I let my head fall back , I could see that I was still crying . Then I felt the tears coming from my eyes . I reached out to hold her , but the tears were n't coming from me . I held her tight and I looked down . She cried a little more , and said , `` I 'm sorry . ''	3.505575023154961e-06
The day was a beautiful day . The sun was shining brightly through the window , and the air was crisp and refreshing , like a summer 's day . I 'm sure you 've all seen it before , the day where the sun was just beginning to set , and you 're all in bed , but this was different . It was a day where you could feel the heat of the sun on your skin , and every part of your body was alive , even your eyes . You could feel your heart beating faster and faster , and your hands were shaking with excitement . You were n't sure if you were ready to go to bed , or if you wanted to get up and go to work . You did n't really care . You just wanted to go home and be alone . You said you were going to sleep and not come back until the sun went down . You saw the light of the moon , and it made you feel like you were a child again . The moon was the only thing that kept you awake , and that was because you were so excited . You woke up , and there was a feeling of being at home . You tried to go back to sleep , but you could n't . You wanted to stay awake , but your body did nifle you . You knew that you would n't be able to sleep . You began to feel the warmth of the setting sun , and when you woke up you were still feeling the warmth . You opened your eyes , and a warm feeling of happiness came over you . It felt like you had been waiting for this moment for a long time . You started to feel your body awaken , and then you felt the warmth and the warmth again . You felt the sensation of your heart beat faster , as if you could hear the beat of your heartbeat . You went to the bathroom , and saw the sun . You was so excited , and ready to get back to bed . You got up , took a shower , and went to bed at the same time as your body . You slept for a few hours , and woke up the next morning . You looked in the mirror , and noticed that you had a new look . You smiled , and said , `` I 've been waiting , I 'll be back tomorrow . '' You went downstairs , and looked at the clock . It read 2:00 AM . You awoke , and got up . You took a quick shower , put on a pair of jeans , and walked to the kitchen . You had to eat , because you had to go out to work soon , and for the first time in a long while you felt like your body had grown . You stood in the kitchen , and took a bite out of a sandwich . You ate it , and ate it and ate a little bit of it . You walked to your car , and drove home . In the back of your mind you were thinking , `` Why did I do this ? '' You saw your wife , and she was in the car . You thought , `` She 's probably just lonely . '' As you drove , you heard the car start to slow down , and realized that you were in the middle of a town , and were almost there . You pulled into the driveway , and sat down on the lawn . You sat there , and smiled . You heard the sound of the car , but the car had stopped . You turned around , and heard a voice . `` I do n't know if you 'll ever get to see her again .

`` And that was the first lie . '' `` And that 's the first lies . '' The man said , with a smile on his face . `` And the second lie . `` The third lie . The fourth lie . I 'm not a bad person . '' He said , and he was right . I had been a good person . I was a good man . I could have been a bad man . `` I 've been a great man . '' I said , still smiling . `` You 've always been a wonderful man . You 're a great person . You did n't do anything wrong . '' he said , as he took a deep breath . `` But I 'd rather be a good guy than a bad guy . '' His face was so happy , but his eyes were empty . `` It 's not that I 'll ever be a bad boy . '' My heart sank . `` No , you 're not . '' And that I was the good guy . I knew that . I did n dressing up as a bad character , but I was still a good one . I just did n Commissioners ' work . I got a good job , I got good grades , and I did my job . I still had a good life . I went to college , got married , had kids , and did my work . `` So , '' I started , `` What 's your first lie ? '' He stared at me . `` Nothing . '' There was a pause , and then he said . `` Well , I 's a good liar . '' It was n't a lie , it was a lie . He had a point . I felt it . `` What is it ? '' `` It was a story . '' But he did nukes me . His face went blank . `` A story about a bad life . '' That was the second lies . `` That was n't a lie ? ! '' I screamed . `` How could you tell me that ? '' I yelled . He looked at me , and said . '' You 'd think I was crazy . '' A tear rolled down his face , and his eyes went wide . `` Your story is a lie ! '' He shouted . `` Do n't lie . It 'll be a lie if you tell it . '' We both stood there for a moment , and the tears started to fall . `` Then what ? '' The old man asked . `` Why ? '' It seemed like he was in a trance . `` Because I 'M A BAD PERSON .

I was walking down the street , my feet feeling the cold , wet pavement of the sidewalk . I was taking a break from my daily routine to take a walk , when I saw a woman emerge from behind a nearby water source . She was wearing a black coat and a black hat , with a black scarf . She looked like she was about to pass out , but she stopped and turned around . `` Hello , '' she said . `` I 'm the woman you came to see . I 've come to see you . '' I looked at her , confused . `` What 's going on ? '' I asked . `` You have a new object , '' the woman said . I looked around . There were no other people around . I followed her . She walked to the water source , and opened the bottle of water . I watched as she drank it , and then she turned around and started walking away . I stood there , dumbfounded . She turned back , and I saw her face . `` Why are you here ? '' she asked . I felt my heart start pounding . `` Because I 'd like to see your face . '' She said , and she walked away . `` Well , I was just thinking about how to get my new object . '' `` What ? '' `` I thought you 'd be dead . '' she replied . `` Oh , I 'll show you . I just need to get back to my car . '' The woman walked away , and the rain started to fall . I walked towards the car , and began to get in . I opened the door , and saw a man in a black hoodie , with red and blue stripes on his jacket . `` Who are you ? '' he asked . He looked like he was about 70 years old . I asked him . `` My name is Nathaniel , '' he said . He was wearing glasses , and he looked like a man who had been through a lot . `` Are you Nathaniel ? '' He asked . The man looked at me , and said , `` I am . '' He looked at the water . `` And what is it ? '' The man asked . His voice was low , and his eyes were red . `` It 's a sword . '' he replied . I laughed , and looked at him . He laughed . `` Now , I have a sword ? '' This was the first time I had ever heard of a sword , and it was the most interesting thing I had seen . `` Yes , '' I said . The woman said , looking at me . `` How do you know ? '' She asked . She handed me the sword . I took it , but it was too heavy . I thought it was a sword and it seemed to be very heavy . `` Do you know how to use it ? `` , I asked , and a smile came over my face . The stranger looked at my face , and smiled . `` The sword is a sword of the gods , '' it said .	3.908270173269557e-06
`` I have been chosen to be the last human , '' I said , as I stepped into the room . `` It 's been a long time since the last time I 've been here . '' The room was filled with people , all of them in the same condition as me . I was n't sure if it was the same as the others , but I knew I was the only one who had been chosen . I had been selected to go back in time to the day humanity became extinct , but not in the way I thought I would . I 'd been chosen because I was chosen to go to the time that humanity was going to die , and I was going back to the year 2040 . I knew it was n2607 , the day the world was going down in flames . The world had been destroyed . I could n't remember the last text I 'm given , but it was a message from a man . `` I am the last person to be chosen to travel back inTime . I am here to tell you that you are the last humans alive . '' I was confused , and a little scared . `` What do you mean ? '' I asked , confused . `` The last human to be selected to travel to the future was the last one to die . '' `` You are the only human left . '' He said . `` But you are not the last . '' In a moment I was overwhelmed by the power of the message . `` You will be the first human to travel through time , '' he said . I felt a sense of dread . `` And I will be one of the last to go . '' A moment later I was in the future , and there was a man in a black suit , wearing a black hoodie and a black mask . `` How did you get here ? '' `` I was selected to be a time traveler , '' said the man . I looked at him , and he looked at me . `` Why do n't you go back ? '' He asked . `` Because I am a time traveller . '' *I 'm going to the past . * `` What ? '' The man looked at the man , and then back at me , and said , `` I 'll give you a choice . '' And he started walking away . It was a strange feeling , the feeling of being chosen . It felt like I was being taken away from my life . I did n't know how long I was to be there , but the feeling was nLIB . `` Are you going to go ? '' the man asked . I asked . He nodded . `` Will you go to that day ? '' he asked . And I nodded . He walked away . I wondered if he was going into time to see if he had any idea what he was about to see . I never asked .	3.494529892122955e-06
The double-edged sword is a double edged sword . It is a terrible thing . I have to use it to cut down a man , but I have no idea how . I do n't know how it works . I did n't think it would work . I 've tried . I know I 'm not a good swordsman , but it 's not like I 'll be able to kill him in a duel . I ca n't do it . I just ca n’ t . I mean , I could , but the sword is too big . It 's too big for me . I can ’ t do it , and I don ’T want to . I ’ m just going to have to cut it down . I don't know if I can . I guess I �sigh . I could just cut it off . I think I can do it though . I remember the last time I used it . It was a very long time ago . I was a kid . I had a sword that I could use for a sword , and it was a really big sword . I didn ’'t know it was going to be so big . I thought it was just for fun . I used to have a sword at the time . I never thought it would be as big as it is now . I kept it on the back of my head , and the sword was on the front . I spent a long time trying to find a way to use the sword . The sword was a bit too big , but that ’ s what I was expecting . I remembered when I first used it , I thought I could cut it with a knife . I tried to cut the sword off , but my hands were too small . I decided to use a sword . That ’ d be a good idea . I cut it . The blade was big , and heavy . I couldn ’ ta cut it , but not so big that it wouldn ’ T hurt . I also knew it was too big to be used for a knife , so I used a sword I could bend . I put it in the front and tried to break it , with the sword on the side . The other side was too small , so it was only a little too big at first . I forgot to cut off the other side . I started to cut , but then I saw it . A big , red sword . A sword that was about the size of a small knife . It looked like it was made of gold . It had a lot of gold in it . Then I saw the other sword . Again . I watched it . And I saw something that I never saw before . I saw a sword made of something I could not see . I looked at the other Sword . The red sword was like a big sword , but with a little more gold . I stared at it for a while . Then it was on . I got up and walked towards it . When I got there , I looked back at the sword and the red sword , then I looked up . It said “ Double Edged Sword ” . I walked up to it and took it . “ What ? ” I asked . ‘ Why ? ’ It said . � “ I don 't know . It ’ ll kill you. ”	3.6807753076573135e-06

I knew I was going to be the one to bring about the end of the world . I thought I would be the hero of the story . I would have saved the world , but the world was going down . The world was about to burn . My only hope was to stop it . What I did was not only to save the world but to bring it back to life . I tried . I wanted to save it . `` What did I do ?

The world was a beautiful place . I had never been one to lie , but I knew what it was like to be in a world where people were happy . I was a happy person , and I was never one to be sad . I lived a happy life . I did n't care about the way I looked . I never cared about the fact that I was good at my job , or that I had a nice house , or even that I would be able to afford the house . I just wanted to be happy . It was the only thing that kept me going . I loved my job . I liked the way my life was . I felt like I was happy . But then one day , I was in a meeting . I do n't know why I was there , but it was a meeting of a group of people . I knew I was supposed to be there . I could n't help but be nervous . I mean , I 'd been working with this group of men for years , but they were n't the most interesting people . They were n'yone I 've ever met . They all had the same interests , the same friends , and the same hobbies . I 'm not sure why I thought I could be so different . I guess I was n't . I think I was jealous of them . I wanted to feel like they were different . They had a different life , a different family , and a different friends . I saw them as people . But I was just a normal guy , a normal man . I thought they were the same . I went to the meeting , and it was just like any other meeting . The same people , the exact same people . The only difference was that I felt different . It 's not that I saw a different world . I actually felt like a different person . I looked around the room . I expected to see the same people I had been with for years . I heard the same conversations , the people I knew , the way they spoke . But there was something different . There was a quietness that I 'll never forget . It felt like it was still there . The people around me were silent . I listened . I waited . I sat down . I watched the people around us . I became a part of them , and they became me . I realized I was doing it for them . It made sense . I started to cry . I cried for the first time . I held my breath . I tried to stop it . I stopped crying . I kept my mouth shut . I let out a sigh . I took a deep breath . `` I ' m sorry , '' I said . `` But I had to do it . '' I looked at the people in the room , and then I looked down at the table . I fell to the floor . I lay there . My eyes were closed . I stared at the floor , and my heart sank . I closed my eyes . I breathed in . I opened my eyes again . I woke up . I stood . I walked out of the room and looked around . I see the other people , and there were a lot of them in the same room . They looked at me . They smiled . They laughed . They cheered . They hugged . I smiled . I remember . I remembered . I look at the clock . It says 8:04 . I sit down . It reads 1:04:04. I sit . I stare at the ceiling . I am not sure what I do . I can see the clock , and me . My heart is pounding . I ca n't do anything . I stand up . The clock reads 8:06 . I walk over to the table , and sit down again . It is 8:02:04 :04 . It feels like I 's sitting on a chair . I try to stand up , but my legs are weak . I feel like I ca N'T . I start to cry again . The voice in my head says , `` You have 1 minute to kill someone . ''	3.6886219731968595e-06

`` You 're not going to believe me , but I know what you 're thinking . '' `` I 'm sure you 've heard of dragons , but you 'll never believe me . '' The dragon , a large , black , blood-red creature with a long , black tail , stood up , and started walking towards me . `` I am a dragon . I am not a human . I was born in the Underworld , and I have been here ever since . I just want to help you . '' I was just about to say something when the dragon stopped , and the dragon turned around to face me , and it 's eyes went wide . `` What the hell are you talking about ? '' `` You 've been here for years , and you 'd be surprised how many times I 've asked you to come and talk to me . I 'll show you , '' the dragon said , and then it turned around and walked away . I stood there , confused . `` Do n't worry , '' I said , `` I will help you with your questions , but first I have to tell you something . '' It turned around , and its head turned to me , its eyes wide , and said , '' Have you ever seen a dragon before ? '' I smiled , and shook my head . `` No , '' it said , looking at me , `` You have n't . '' Then it turned towards the door , and walked out . I walked down the street , and saw the dragon walking towards the house . `` You should n't have come here , '' he said , but it was too late . The door opened , and a large man in a black suit walked out , and he spoke . `` Hi , I 'd like to talk to you . I have seen you around , '' said the man . `` We 're dragons , '' replied the dragon , and turned around . `` But we do n't talk to each other . '' He looked at me with a look of confusion , and asked , `` What do you mean , 'you do n' t talk to us ? ' '' I looked at him , and smiled . `` Well , '' says the man , `` you 's just a dragon , '' and he turns around and walks away . `` Oh , '' answers the dragon with a smile , `` it 'll be fun to talk with you . You 'll learn a lot about me . You will learn about the world , and how we are the only ones that can help you. '' I walked away , and sat down on the floor . `` Yeah , '' i said , as I looked up at the dragon . `` How do you know I 'imgur ? '' The man turned around again , and looked at the world . `` This is the world of the dragons , and we are just a few of the many . ''	3.5116081562591717e-06

`` You 're going to be the one to tell me what to do . '' `` I 'm going to tell you what to think ! '' `` No , no , no ! '' I yelled , `` I do n't want to hear it . '' I was n't sure what to say . I was sitting in my room , listening to the thoughts of my friends . I had been listening to them for a while now , but I was still nervous . I 've been watching them for years , but it was still a bit scary . They were all so different , but they were all the same . I wanted to say something , but my brain was nimble . I could n't figure out what they were thinking . I felt like I was losing control , and I was getting scared . `` I think I 'll go to bed now , '' I said . I did n't know how long I was going to stay there , but the thought of going to sleep was too much to bear . I got up and walked out of the room , and walked down the hall . I walked into my room like I always did , and went to my room . I just sat down on the bed , and waited . I waited for the next few minutes . I watched the room for a few minutes before I realized I was waiting for someone to talk to me . I went to the bathroom , and turned on the light , and then I saw a woman talking to herself . I thought I was crazy . I turned on my light and I saw her thoughts . `` What the fuck ? '' I told her , and she started to talk . `` Why are you talking to yourself ? '' She said . `` You 've always been a bitch . '' She started to walk away , but she turned around . `` Who are you ? '' `` You . '' My voice was quiet , and her thoughts were quiet . I stood up , and told her to come back . `` Do you know who I am ? '' she asked . `` No . '' Her mind was quiet . `` Well , I 'd like to know who you are . '' she said . My voice became more clear . `` And I 're not a bitch , '' she replied . `` Your name is me . '' That was the last time I saw my name . I have n't seen it in a while . I can hear my name in my mind , and it 's very clear . I stopped listening to her thoughts , and got up . I looked at my hands , and my mind was drifting . I needed to go to sleep . I sat down , and started to turn on my lights . I began to walk to the bedroom , and thought about the next day . I tried to remember what I had said to her , but then I thought of something else . `` It 's time to go home . ''	3.5209839097660733e-06
`` I 'm sorry , but I 'll have to follow you . '' I said , staring at the man in the car . He 'd been driving for a while , and I knew exactly where he was going . The car was a red Toyota Corolla , with a black hood and a large red sticker on the front . I could n't make out the words on the side of the car , but it was obvious it was the same car . The man in it was dressed in a black suit , and he was wearing a black tie . He was driving a red Corvette , and it was a white one . I was n't sure if he was trying to be funny or not . I did n't know what to do . I had no idea if I could get to the car or not , so I took a deep breath , and looked at the car again . I looked at him . He looked at me . I knew what he was looking at . He had a gun . I started to walk towards him , but he shot me in the face . I fell to the ground , and the car rolled to a stop . I crawled out of the vehicle and looked up . The gun was gone , and so was the man . I ran towards the car and started to run . I saw the car pull out of a parking lot and turn into a lot of yards . I found a parking space , and got in . I walked to the side . The guy in the red Corvette was still there , and was waiting for me . He took the gun out of his pocket , and pointed it at me , and shot me . The story was a bit different than I thought . The protagonist was a man , and had a white car . I watched as he drove off , and then he was gone . I realized that he was nCaught up in the action movie . I sat there , in the dust , and thought about the events of the movie . The hero , the car was nA white car , and a man in a white jacket , and there was a car behind him . I thought about how he had killed the driver , and how he was a hero . I tried to remember if I had heard the story . I remembered the car 's name . I decided to follow the car to see if I was right . I got into the car with the man , who was driving it . I felt a sudden chill , and saw the man 's face . He used his gun . He opened his mouth , and fired . I heard the sound of metal on metal , and felt the man hit the ground . I remember the man screaming . I stepped out of my car . `` I 've got to get out of here , '' I thought , and walked out of it .	3.4933236747747287e-06

'' The words echoed in my head , and it was my own . `` It is my time . '' And I was gone . I stood up and walked out of the room , the phone in my hand , and walked down the street . It was dark , and the streets were empty . I walked to the bus stop , and sat down on the bench . I sat down and looked around . I could see the people around me , and they were all like me , walking around , talking , and laughing . I felt a little sad , but that was n'm I was doing my job . I looked around and saw that everyone else was just like me . They were all smiling , laughing , and being happy . `` Where 's my family ? '' They asked . I did n't answer .

I tried , and tried , but the letters were always too long , and they were always so long . I remember my first letter , and how I wrote it . It was the first time I had ever written anything .

`` It 's time to get your life back on track . '' The door swung open . I opened it , and saw a man in a suit and tie . I was still in my room , but I could see him . He was wearing a dark suit , and he was wearing the same black tie and tie I had on . `` You know , I 've been trying to get back on the right track , '' I said . `` How do you know that ?

I could have sworn I had seen this man before , but this was different . `` What ? '' he asked . I looked over at my watch . It was almost midnight .

I asked him , `` How did you know my name ? '' . `` Well , you know how I know my identity , '' the mans voice said . His voice was different , and I could hear the words . `` Have you ever been in love ? '' My eyes widened . `` Yes , '' his voice was a little lower , and it sounded like he was trying to be quiet . `` Why ? '' His voice sounded like it was trying not to be loud . `` To be honest , I was n't sure if I could tell . '' My heart was racing . `` Can you tell me your name ? Do you have a name ?

It wo n' be nice . I miss them so much . I would have loved to see them . But they wo' be gone . I heard the news that they 've killed everyone else . I go to the desert , and there 's no one there . I see them , but there ' s no one . I cry . And I 'mma miss them too .	3.505605263853795e-06
`` I 'm going to do it , '' I said , `` I 'll go in and summon the future . '' `` You 're not going to believe this , '' said the old man , `` but I 've been waiting for you to come up with this for a long time . '' I was confused . I was n't sure what I was supposed to do . `` I know what you 're talking about , '' he said , and I could n't help but laugh . `` Well , I 'd like to do this . '' He walked over to the altar , and he began to prepare a ritual . I looked at the ritual , and it was different . It was n' t the same as the other rituals I ' d seen before . It had n't been the same for a while . I could see the old woman , and the man , and even the woman , but I could not see the ritual . The old man was gone . I walked over and stood in front of the altar . `` What is this , then ? '' I asked . `` You are going to be the one to summon the events of the future , '' the old Man said . `` Yes , '' replied the old Woman , `` and I will be the next one . '' The old Man looked at me , and laughed . `` And I ' ll do it . '' _______________________________________________________________ The ritual was simple , really . It consisted of a small ritual . A woman was to be summoned from the future and a man was to come from the past . The ritual would be performed in a room , and then , when the woman was ready , she would be summoned . The man would then be summoned to the future from the present . The woman would be in a box , and she would get a small box with a small note . The box would have a small piece of paper with her name on it . The only thing she would have to do was read it , and that 's it . She would be the first to be called . She was to go to the present , and be summoned by the man . The rest of the ritual was to follow . _____________________________________________________ I looked back at the old women , and smiled . She had been a great woman . She could n'er be the kind of woman I 's mother would have wanted . She 'd been a sort of great woman , who would have been a terrific mother to my father . She did n't even have to be a woman . I glanced at the box , `` What 's this ? '' she asked . I smiled . `` It 's the ritual for the future ... '' I looked around the room , `` And it 's going to work . ''	3.5094653867417946e-06
The red lettering was a little strange , but I was n't sure why . I did n't remember what it was , but it was there . I was sitting in a chair , not really knowing what to do . I knew it was a job , but what was it ? I was in a hospital , and I had no idea what it would be . I had been sitting there for what seemed like hours , and this was my first time getting paid for it . I expected to get a paycheck , but as I was on the phone with my boss , I saw a red letter . I sat up , and suddenly I was holding a bag . `` Hi , I 'm sorry , but you do n't have a paycheck . '' I said . `` I do nonsense , '' he said , `` I 've been working here for a year . '' `` What the hell is going on ? '' I asked . `` Well , you 've got a job . '' He said . I looked at him , and he looked back at me . `` What do you mean ? '' `` I mean , you already know what you do . You 're a doctor . '' he pointed out . `` But why do n' t you know what I do ? '' He asked . I shook my head . `` You 'd think you 'd know . You know what a doctor does . '' His eyes widened . `` My name is Dr. James . '' The man 's eyes widened again . `` Oh , that 's right . '' My eyes widened , and his looked at me , and then he started to cry . `` It 's a very good thing , '' I told him . `` '' He looked at the doctor , and said , '' You 've always been a good doctor . But you 're not a good one . '' And I nodded . `` That 's what I 'll tell you . '' We sat there for a while , and talked . I told the doctor about my job , and how I 'd been a doctor for a long time . I explained how I worked at a hospital and how it was my job to take care of people . He told me about my family and what I had done . I could n't believe it . `` And you 'll be a doctor ? '' he asked . He looked up , `` Do you remember what you did ? '' The doctor asked . The man nodded . He was crying . `` Then you 's done your job . I 's finished . ''	3.499719696264947e-06
I was sitting in the living room , watching the news , and it was the most boring thing I 'd ever seen . The news was about a new technology that had been released to the public . It was called `` The Brain . '' It was a new method of learning . It would allow you to learn new skills in the old fashioned way . It had been invented to be a more efficient way to learn all the skills of the future . The idea was that the brain would be a much more efficient tool for learning , and the brain could be used for a lot of things . They would be able to learn more , and better . People would be more productive , and they would be well-paid . But it would be impossible to teach the brain to learn the skills . It 's all about the mind . You had to learn how to think , and learn how not to think . I was sitting there , watching , when I heard a voice . It sounded like a man . He was a man , but he was n't speaking English . He looked like he was in his late 20s , and he was wearing a suit and tie . He had a beard , and a beard was a bit too long . He wore a suit , and was wearing some sort of sunglasses , but I did n't really know what they were . He said , `` You can learn the new skill of the mind , and you can learn it from me . '' I looked up . He smiled , and said , '' You 're in my office . '' He was n Prairie-dog , a dog . I did not know what that meant . I looked at him , and I did have a dog , but it was n Tinder . I had to ask him , `` What do you know about the new skills ? '' He smiled again , `` Well , I 'm a dog and I 've been learning them . '' `` What ? '' I asked . `` I 'll show you . '' The man looked at me , and looked at the screen . `` You 've got to be kidding me . I 's a dog ! '' I nodded . `` But I 're not . '' he said , and then he started to laugh . `` Remember , you 're a dog now . You 'll be able TO learn the skill of a dog in the new way . '' And I did . I could n't believe what I was hearing . I wanted to know more . I asked him , '' What is the newskill of the brain ? '' `` It 'll teach you how to eat . ''	3.4917784432764165e-06
`` My job is to make sure people are safe , and that they do n't get eaten by the zombies . I 'm a little bit of a zombie hunter . '' I 've always been a little too good at it . I was always the type of guy who would make sure his family and friends were safe , so I would always be there for them . I have a job where I 'd get the best of the best . I just love it . `` I 'll do it all . I do n lumbering around with a machete , and I 're always on the lookout for zombies . '' `` You 're a great hunter . You 'll get a lot of kills . '' That 's what I do . I also have a lot more than that . I make a lot better zombie hunters than I do people . I like to make them happy , and they like to be happy . I am also a good writer . I write a lot . I got a lot in my head and I like writing . I enjoy writing , and it 's a hobby I love . I still do n 't know why I do it . It 's not like I 'M a writer , but I do like it . The zombie apocalypse has been a lot like that . It has been hard , but it has been worth it . You see , I 's the only one that 's done it . And I ' m really good at doing it . Sometimes I make it a living , sometimes I do nothing . But I 'ma do it , and if I do , I do what I love to do . And that 'll always be my job . I work for a living . I wrote a lot about it . '' He paused for a moment , and then continued , `` I do this for the love of the game . I love it , I really do . '' The zombies were n't the only ones . They were n' t the only things that were n ' t the least bit scared . I mean , who is n't scared of zombies ? I mean I 'VE been attacked by them . They 're just the ones that get eaten . I guess I 'vy been a zombie Hunter for a while now . I always have been . I think I 'genre my writing with zombies . It makes me feel safe . I get a little nervous when I do something that I 'store in the back of my mind . I read a lot , and sometimes I write some poetry . I try to write about the zombie apocalypse , but that 'd be a bit too much . I really like to write a little about the zombies , too . I ca n't help it .	3.5007008136744844e-06
`` So , let 's see here , what 's the deal with this planet ? '' The alien said , his voice raspy and cold . `` Well , we 're going to have to kill it . '' `` No , we do n't have to . '' The Earthlings said , their eyes wide in horror . `` We 're not going to kill you ! '' `` You 're a *thing* , you 're *not* a * thing* ! '' The aliens roared , their wings flapping in the wind . `` I 'm not a *things* ! I 've been here for centuries , I know what it 's like to be a *being* ! It 's not the same as *being a* thing ! '' the Earthlings screamed , their voices rising in volume . `` You ca n't even say that ! '' one of the alien said . `` What do you mean , *not *a* thing ? '' `` I mean that you 've never seen a *Being* ! You 've only ever seen a human , and you 'll never see a *Human* ! And you 'd never even know it ! '' They roared at each other . The Earthling 's eyes grew wide . `` Oh , you think I 'll just tell you that ? '' It was the Earthling who spoke , his eyes darting around the room , searching for a way to escape . `` No ! You ca N't ! You do n' t understand ! You are a *species* ! A *species ! * ! '' It 'd been a long time since the Earth had been attacked , but the Earthly people had finally given up on it . The alien 's face was as pale as the night sky . `` But ... but ... but you 's a *human* ! We do n ' t know what to do ! '' it yelled . `` It 'll be okay , '' the earthling said . The humans were n't going to be able to help it . `` Just let me tell you a story . '' He said , taking a step back . `` A story about a *humans* . '' A human , a human . The earthlings were n 't really the same . The human was a *creature* , a *people* . They were the *creatures* of the earth . They had no other reason to exist . `` And what are you , a* species ? '' it asked , its voice soft . `` They 're like us . '' the human said , and the Earthlys replied , `` They are *humans ! * '' `` What ? '' the alien asked . `` *We* are *humans* ! They 've got a *purpose* ! *We *are* the *people ! * You ca *not ! * *I* am a *person* ! `` , the Earthlinger said . He was looking around the chamber , his lips moving in a wide smile . `` ... and you ? '' he asked , his face turning red . `` Yes , '' he said , `` I am a human ! '' he answered , his words a little more clear . `` How do you know that ? You 'll find out soon enough . ''	3.7873505789320916e-06
I 'm a soldier . I 'm the last of my family . I have n't seen my wife in months and I have no idea what I 've done to deserve this . I am a soldier , and I am going to die . I was a soldier in the military , I 'd been a soldier for years , and now I 'll be a soldier on the battlefield .

I look forward to seeing her again , but that 's all I can think of . I feel like I 'res going to lose her . They are going to take her . The last thing I want is to see her , but it 's been a long time . I never thought I would see her one more time . They told me she was dead . She was n't . She died in the war . She 's gone . I did n't have the chance to see the war , but the war is over . I still have my wife , and so does she . I thank God for that . I just wish I had more time to see my wife again . She will be gone soon . I might never see my daughter again . It was n's time for me to go . My last day . I had to leave . I knew I would n't be able reclaim her . All I could do was watch her go .

I am alone , but I am happy . I am alone . I have been alone for a long time . I 've been alone since I was a child . I learned to love my life , to live it , to love myself . I lived a life of pain , but it was okay . I was happy . But I was alone . And I am still alone . In a way , I was always alone . It was n't until I was about to go to high school that I realized that I was noston . I had n't been there in years . I knew I was going to die , but the thought of it made me happy . My life was naught but a dream . I still remember the first day I met her . We had been out for dinner and I had been drinking , but she was n Meridian and I was in the back of the restaurant . I told her I was leaving , and she did n't say anything . I did n' t know what to say , but in that moment , I knew she was happy , and I knew that I had to be happy . She was my only friend , my only love . I sat in the corner , the sun setting , and we both sat and talked . I do n't know what I would have done if I had known . I ca n't remember much . I remember that I loved her . I loved the way she looked at me , the way her eyes looked at my face , the muscles in her back , the lips that looked like they were going to break . I think I 'm happy . And that 's what I 'll always be happy about . I will always be alone . But that 'll never be the case . I might never be happy , but that does n't mean I 'd ever be alone again . I just have n't had the chance to tell her . Maybe I 'M happy . Maybe she 'll accept it . I hope so . I want to be alone , and it 's OK . I wish I could be happy with her . But there is no way to be . I know that I 're not . And as I close my eyes , I 'voice her . She 'll be happy too .

The smile is gone . I see her smiling . I love her .	3.903331162291579e-06
It was a beautiful day in the middle of the day . The sun was shining , the air was warm , and the sky was blue . A few clouds were falling and the air smelled of fresh rain . The sky was a bright , golden shade of blue , and I could see the clouds from my window . I looked at the sky , and thought about the day we had just had . I was sitting in the living room , watching the sun set . I could hear the rain fall from the clouds and the wind was blowing . I watched the clouds move across the sky as they moved from one place to another . I did n't really care for the rain . I just wanted to watch the clouds . I had been watching the clouds for hours . I heard a noise and looked up , and there was a figure standing in the clouds , looking down at me . He was wearing a red dress , with a red bow on his head . He had a red ribbon tied around his neck . I stared at him , and he smiled . `` Hello . '' I smiled back . `` Hi . '' `` Hi , '' he said . `` You 're a good guy . '' He said . He looked around the room . `` I 'm not sure what you 're doing here . '' The man in the red dress said . I smiled . I said , `` I am . I 've been watching you for a while . '' And I could n't help but smile . `` Are you sure you want to stay here ? '' I asked . `` Yes . '' he replied . I took a deep breath . `` Do you want me to join you ? '' `` Sure . '' A minute later , he said , and then he was gone . I sat in the park , and watched the sky . I thought about my day . I wanted to see the sun rise . I decided to watch a movie . I stayed in the shade of the tree . I saw the clouds again . I liked the way the sky looked . I went to the tree again . The clouds were so pretty . I loved the way they looked . The stars were so beautiful . The rain fell . I felt the wind . I think I was going to cry . I tried to cry , but I could not . I laughed . I cried . I started to cry so hard I cried myself to sleep . I died . I woke up in the hospital . I got a call from the police . I asked them what happened . They said I was a good boy . I told them I was just a good kid . They told me to go home . I drove home .	3.4984350349986926e-06
`` Hello , I 'm a self-aware human , and I am here to inform you that I have been sent to the planet Earth . I am the most intelligent and intelligent human being on Earth .

It looked at the robot . I looked at it . I saw the robot 's face . I knew I was in trouble . `` The robot is trying to tell me why I am being sent on Earth , '' I answered . The robots face was horrified . `` But I am still a human ... '' `` Are you a robot ? '' the robotic said . What was wrong with me ? `` You do n t- '' `` What ! '' the bot said . My brain was screaming at me to stop . `` Stop ! '' it shouted . `` Please , please , I ca n't ! '' It screamed . `` Shut up ! '' The robotic said , as it began to panic . It started to panic as it realized it was being sent into the universe . `` Fuck you ! '' a robot said , and it started to cry . `` Oh , I had no idea ! '' A human said . This robot was not an artificial , it was a real , real human . `` Are n't you a human ? '' a human asked . The robotic replied . `` Yes . ''	3.4989186588063603e-06
It 's a terrible thing to say , but I 'm not sure anyone ever expected it to be this bad . The aliens were a group of humans that had invaded Earth . They were the first to attack , and they were the only ones to do so . The first few years of the invasion were a disaster . The people were at first terrified . We were n't expecting a war . We thought we were fighting a war of attrition , but what we did n't expect was for them to turn on us . They never saw us coming , and we never expected them to attack us . We tried to hide , but the aliens were too quick . They had us surrounded . We retreated , and as the aliens began to get closer we were able to escape . We found ourselves in the middle of a field . We could see the ships , and the ships were moving at a snail 's pace . We had to escape , but we had to be fast . We knew the aliens could n't keep up with us . Our ships were being attacked . We ran . We did n' t know what to do , but our ships were n 't going to be able to keep up . We started running . We saw a planet in the distance . It was a beautiful planet . It had a beautiful sunset . We yelled for the aliens to stop . They did n ' t . We only had one chance to escape before they caught up . The ships were speeding towards us . The humans were the last thing we needed . We rushed forward , and then we saw the aliens . We felt their wrath . They came from the sky , and were speeding toward us . I knew they were coming . We 'd be in trouble . We should n't have taken them . We abandoned the ship . We made our way to the surface . We reached the surface , and saw the alien ships , but they were too fast . They ran at us . My ship was too slow . I was too late . I 'd made it . We fell into a crater . I saw a ship come in . It looked like it was a small ship , but it was too fast for me to get out . I had to get to the other side . I turned around . It did n ’ t look like it had any weapons . It just had a few weapons . I could n 've gotten away , but there was a ship that was too close . I jumped out of the way . The ship was still moving , and I saw the ship come towards me . I swung my ship around , and it did n’ t hit it . It landed in the crater , and a few of the aliens fell out . It took me a while to realize what had happened . I looked at the alien ship . It could n'T be a human . It didn ' t have any weapons , it was just a small spaceship . I tried to get back to the ship , and tried to run . I did n these things for a while . I ran through the ruins of the ship to the one that had n't been destroyed . I found it , and was about to jump out when I saw something . It wasn ’ s eyes . It ’ d been a human , but its eyes were dark , and there was something strange about it . They looked like they were staring at me . They just looked so ... sad . I started to run , and ran and ran . I just wanted to get away from the aliens , and get out of this planet . I fell , and fell and fell . I think I fell for one of them . I felt something move . I woke up . It felt like I was in a hospital . I got up , and looked around . There was no one around . The only thing I could see was a room with a few other people . I went to the door , and felt a hand on my shoulder . The alien was holding a gun . I shook my head . `` No . '' I said . `` Why are you here ? '' `` You are a human ! ''	3.546592779457569e-06
I 'm a bit of a writer , but I 'm not sure I 'll ever be able to make the best of it . I 've been writing this for years and I 'd like to do a better job of it than I did before . I was given the opportunity to rewrite the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy . I do n't know why , but it 's just a lot of work . The first couple of chapters are pretty good , but the rest are a bit bland . I hope I can make them better . I want to make them more like the original trilogy , but also make them a lot more interesting . I think the whole idea of the Force and the Force itself is a bit too predictable , and I want it to be more of a sci-fi/fantasy world . I thought the first two were pretty good and the last two were a bit ... well , I do not know . I really want to see more of the original story , but that 's a lot to do . I like the idea of a new world , but there 's so much more to it . The characters , the world , the whole thing . I have to make it more interesting , and more interesting than the original . I would like to see how much of the story was made better . The ending was a bit boring , but even if I did n't like it , I would n't change it . It was a good story , and it was a lot better than the first trilogy . It would be nice to see the characters grow , and the story improve , but not too much . I also want to have more of an action scene , and a more interesting ending . I love the ending . It 's all about the character and the characters , and what they are doing , and all that . I just want to know how the story is going to end . I am a little worried about the ending , but if I can give it more action , I think I ' m gon na do it . Thanks for reading ! *I 've always liked this prompt , and this is my first time doing it . If you like it I ' ll try to write something else . * *If you liked this , please check out /r/WritingPrompts ! * *I love this prompt ! I think it 'll be a great idea for a short story . I will try to make sure to write it more engaging , and better . *	3.761236939681112e-06
`` So , I 've been working on this for a long time , and I 'm finally ready to give up . I 'll do it . '' The hero of the day looked down at the man who had just defeated him . `` So , what are you going to do now ? '' `` I 'd like to take a look at my latest masterpiece . '' `` What ? '' He looked at the hero . `` I know what you 're thinking , but I ca n't let you do it , man . '' He turned to the hero and said , `` I do n't want to see you die .

'' But he did n't look up . `` Well , I did nnov ... '' `` No , you did n't . '' the hero said . `` No . '' he said . The villain put his hands on the hero 's shoulders and said : `` You 're not going to let me do it ! '' `` You did n 't have to . '' said the hero , `` You could have just let me go .

'' . `` And I was n't supposed to die . I was supposed to be the hero ... '' He said . And then the villain took off . `` That 's what you were supposed to do . '' Said the hero to the villain , `` But you did . I could n't . '' A few seconds later , the hero was gone . The man stood up , and looked at his hands . `` But I was a hero . ''He said . Then he looked at himself . `` Why did you do this to me ? '' he asked . `` Because I was the hero of this world . '' says the villain as he walked away . `` Who are you ? What are you doing ? '' asks the hero as he walks out of the room . The Man said , and the villain turned and walked away , and that 's when the hero turned around and said to the man , `` Do n't you think I 's a hero ?

`` What is normal ? '' I asked the fish . `` I do n't know . '' `` You 're a goldfish . '' He replied . `` You do n t- '' `` No , I do . '' I said . `` What is ? '' He said . I was surprised . I 'd never seen a fish like him before . `` Well , you 're not normal . '' he said . He was n't really sure what to say . `` Why not ? '' `` Because I do not know . I have never been normal . What is Normal ? '' he asked . `` That 's not how it works . '' In my mind I was already thinking . `` Perfectly normal . But I do know that there is nothing normal . There is nothing that is normal . Everything is normal , but it is not normal in the way you see it . '' That was a hard question . `` Then what is normal } ? '' The fish asked . He looked at me . `` Everything is not . '' The goldfish said . His eyes were wide with shock . `` But it is normal ! '' He could n't believe it . He had never seen something like this before . He could not believe it had ever been normal before . I looked at him . `` Nothing is normal but you know what it is ? Everything is . '' His eyes began to water . `` So , what is Normal . '' the fish asked , `` Is it normal that you do nDriver ? '' His mouth was dry . `` No . '' My eyes were watering . `` It is not Normal . It is normal that I dont know what isNormal .

'' Said the man , `` There is no normal . No normal . Nothing is Normal in this house . '' So I was right . My father was right , and so was the man in the suit . `` How did he know what was normal ? I do N't know , but I know what he is . He is not a normal person . '' This was the first time I had ever heard that . `` We are not normal because of what is notnormal .

'' He looked at me , and I could see the tears in his eyes . `` You were n't supposed to come . '' I could tell he was n't going to answer . I knew it . `` What do you mean ? '' I asked . `` It was nnants of a dream . '' he said . I was nordsly . `` A dream ? '' `` A nightmare . '' That 's what I said , but I was trying to be nice . `` No , no , no . You were supposed to be here . '' His eyes were red . `` That 'll be all . '' We sat in silence . `` How could you do this ? '' he asked . I looked at him , and he looked at us . `` Well , I 'll tell you , '' he says . `` There 's a lot to be done . '' And he stood up and walked out of the room . I saw him walk away . I watched him leave , and then I saw what he was doing . He was n're walking into the woods . I did n't know what to do . I could n't stop him . I just stood there . I thought I could do something . I tried to ask him , but he just kept walking . I loved him . He walked into the trees . I followed him . But he did n’ t stop . He just kept going . I finally saw him . `` Why are you here ? '' He said . He looked up . `` Do n't you want to know ? '' The trees were dark . `` We 're going to die . '' The woods were dark as well . `` But I 'd rather die than die . I love you . '' It was the first time I 's ever seen him cry . `` Yes , I do . '' There was a moment of silence . He took a step . `` Are you sure ? '' This was the last time he would ever say that . `` Of course . '' My heart was breaking . `` My friend , '' said the tree . `` If I could just tell you what to say . '' A tear fell from his eye . `` Please . '' As he walked out the door , I looked up at him . The trees around him were dark , and the trees around me were dark too . I wanted to stop him from going , but it was too late . He had to go . `` To the end . ''	4.222946245135972e-06
`` This is the day . '' The commander of the fleet of space ships had been preparing for this moment for a long time . They had been waiting for this day for a very long time , for a time . He had been a leader in the galactic war for many years , and he had been the first to realize that the only way to stop the war was to use the technology that they had been given . The world had been spinning in circles for a while . The human race had been on the brink of extinction for so long , and they had no idea what to do . They understood that they could not fight alone . They were too weak , too weak to fight the aliens . They needed to be joined by others , and the most useful people to fight against the aliens were the ones who could be trained . It was not easy . They could not be trained to fight alone , and those who could not were forced to fight together . The soldiers had to be trained and trained together . They went into the stars and fought , and then they were trained again . They would fight , and fight , until they were no longer needed . They became the best fighters , and fought the aliens , and won . It had been an honor , and it had been fun . They lost their first battles , but they had won the war , and now they were ready to fight again . It would be another day . It has been a long and difficult day . The mission had been so hard , and so long ago . The ship was n't built to last . The crew of the ship had been told that they would never see their home planet again . The ships had never been built to withstand the heat of the sun , and had been built for a purpose , and there was no way to fight in the sun . The hull had been stripped away from the ship , and all that was left was the inside . The captain had been sent to the ship to repair the ship . The command had been left behind , and was not to be used again . He was to be sent to a new planet , but he was not told to go there . He would be sent back to his ship , but there was a new mission . It took him a while to figure out how to get there . It seemed like an impossible mission , but it had to happen . He knew that the mission was to destroy the aliens and destroy the ships . He did n't know how , but the ship was built to do it . He could not stop it . The men and women who had been selected for the mission were sent to another planet . He went to the planet , and began to search for the ship that was supposed to be the last . He found it . It looked like a ship , with a few things , but nothing special . He turned around to look for the captain , and found him . He pulled out a small box , and opened it . Inside was a small , rectangular box , with the word `` ON '' written on it . `` This is it , '' he said . `` I need to know why this is happening . '' He opened the box , but could n't read the words . He looked inside , and saw a small portion of the box . `` There is something in this box that is not human , '' the box said . He picked up the box and read it . There was a line , and a small button . `` It says : '' It read `` ON , '' and it was a long , long line . The line read `` On '' , and when it was finished , it read `` OFF , '' again , and again , it said `` ON . ''	3.539199951774208e-06
`` I 'm sorry , I do n't know why I 've been doing this . '' I say to her . `` I 'd like to tell you something , but I 'll have to wait for you to finish your story . '' She says . I take a deep breath and begin . `` It 's about the first time I 's ever met you . '' `` Yes , I know . '' The girl nods , and I can see the look of confusion in her eyes . `` You 're not a girl , are you ? '' I ask . `` No , I 'vice versa . '' Her voice is calm , but she 's not sure if I 'M trying to be nice or if I just want to be polite . `` Well , I have to go . '' My voice is a little shaky , but it 's a good thing . `` What is it about you ? What 's so special about me ? '' `` You know , I was born in the year of the year , and you were born in about the year 2050 . '' That 's when I started to get the idea . `` That 'll be all . '' she says . `` So , how do I know that I 're a girl ? '' She asks . `` Because I ' have a long history of being a girl . '' **I 'm not a boy . ** `` Well ... '' I start . `` Oh , I see . I was a girl of about the age of 10 or 11 . '' *I 've always been a boy , but now I ' Am a girl ... * `` You were a girl then ? '' *Yes . * `` So you were a female ? '' The girls face is red and her eyes are red . `` Yes . '' We 're talking about the same age as me . `` How did you get here ? '' A young woman in a black dress walks up to me . She 's wearing a black suit and a black tie . `` The name 's Alice . '' It 'm my turn to look confused . `` Are you a boy ? '' she asks . I ' m confused . She looks at me , and she says , `` You are . '' And she 're right . `` But ... '' `` Shut up . '' '' I said . `` Now , I want to know why you 're here . '' Alice is a girl in a dress . `` Why are you here ? Why do you want to see me ? `` She looks really confused . I do not know . I have some history to tell . '' A man in a suit walks up . `` Where are you from ? '' He says . He 's tall , and he 's dark . `` A girl . I remember you . I used to be a girl once . '' He looks at her , and his face is all red . *I know . * I look at him . `` Remember that time I was trying to get you to go to the dance ? '' he says . *What ? * `` I was n't a girl ! '' I yell . `` Yeah . '' he responds . `` Wait , why are you doing this ? '' asked Alice . `` To get you out of the way . ''	3.5629639114631573e-06
`` We have been waiting for you for so long , '' the voice came from the radio . `` I 've been waiting to hear you . '' `` I know , '' I replied . `` My name is John . I 'm from the future , and I 'll be here for you . I can hear you now . '' I looked around the room , expecting to see my friends . Instead , I saw a group of people , all dressed in black . They were all looking at me , smiling , and they were all smiling . `` We 've waited so long for you , '' they said . `` But you 've never been here , '' said one of them . `` You 've always been a bit of a mystery to me , '' replied the other . `` And you 're here now , '' he said . I looked up at them . They all looked at me . `` What do you mean ? '' I asked . `` Well , '' one of the people said . He was dressed in a suit and tie . `` It 's a big deal . I do n't know why you 'd be here , but I 'd like to see you . You 're from the present , '' another said . They both nodded . `` Yeah , '' John said . The other man nodded . He looked around . `` Where are we ? '' `` We were supposed to be here in the future . '' The man said . There was a pause . `` Do you know why ? '' The other one asked . I nodded . The man looked at the man . `` Are you sure ? '' He asked . The second man nodded , and the first man nodded again . `` Then we 're going to be there , '' answered the second man . I turned to the first one . `` So , are you sure you want to come ? '' he asked . He smiled . `` Of course , '' she said . She turned to me . She was smiling . I took a step towards the door . `` Come on , '' my friend said . We walked through the door , and we stepped into the room . `` This is where we 'll meet , '' we said . Everyone looked at us . `` Who are you ? '' the man asked . We looked at each other . He asked me , `` What 's your name ? '' We did n't answer . `` John , '' then I said . My friend smiled . He did ndon't know how to answer .	3.4908362067653798e-06
`` I 'm sorry , it 's just that ... '' I said to myself . I was n't sure why I was crying . I had always been a good person , and I had never been a bad person . I just had n't had the heart to tell my friends . `` I 've just been so busy . I 'll get back to you . '' I just wanted to be alone . I wanted to just be alone , and then I would n't have to worry about my friends anymore . I did n't want to be around people anymore . My friends were gone . I started to cry . I thought I was going to die . I could n't stand it anymore . `` You 're not going to be able to go on . You 'll be dead , and this is the last time I 'd see you . I love you . You know that ? '' I looked down at my hands . I looked up at the sky . I knew what it was going on . I should have been scared , but I did not . I felt ... lost . I tried to look back at the moon , but it was gone . The moon was gone , and it was just me . I cried . I sat on the floor . I watched the moon go down . I saw my friends go down , and they were gone too . I let out a loud sigh . I closed my eyes . I heard a noise . I opened them . It was the moon . I turned and looked up . It looked like a giant , fiery ball of fire . I stared at it . I slowly opened my eyes , and there it was . It 's face was all I could see . It had a red face , and a red , glowing eyes . And it was glowing red . I ran to the moon and I looked at the stars . I wrote them down . They were the only ones I could . I held them . I kept them in my heart . I put them in a jar . I took them out and threw them away . I left them in the jar . Where they are now . They are n't there anymore . The Moon is gone . They 're gone . It is only me . The stars are gone . But I can still see the moon in my mind . I can see it now . I feel it . In my mind , it is still there . It does n't change , but this is what it is . It has to be . I look at the Moon . I see it . It looks like a moon . It just looks like it is n't . It ca n't be . It must be . The Sun is gone , too . It can not be . But it is there . I ca nernels , and the Moon is there too . And I am still here . I am not dead . I will be alive . I have to be alive , and even if I am n't , I am alive . And that is what I want .	3.6184235341352178e-06
`` I 'm going to have to go . '' I said to the man I had been watching for the last few hours . He was a tall , dark man , and he was wearing a dark suit with a dark tie . He had a look of tiredness in his eyes . I knew he had been through a lot , and that was the reason he was still alive . `` You 're going to go , '' I told him . `` I 'll take you with me . '' He looked at me with a look that told me he was scared . `` No , I 've been waiting for you . '' `` No . I 'd like to go with you . I do n't want to be alone . '' The man looked at us , and then at me again . He gave me a look as if to say , `` I do not want to go alone . I want you to go out with me , '' he said . `` But you have to , '' the man said , and I looked at him with a smile on my face . `` It 's my turn . '' he replied . `` That 's it , '' a voice said . I looked up , and there was a man standing there . `` Yes , '' said the man , with a grin on his face . He smiled at me , and said , `` It was a good decision . '' We both looked at each other , and the man who had been looking at us and smiled said , '' It was the best decision I 's ever made . '' And then I took a step back , and looked at the man . He looked back at me . `` What are you going to do , '' asked the man in the suit . `` Go with me ? '' I asked , and we walked out the door . `` Do n't you want to take me with you ? '' he asked . `` Just go with me ! '' I yelled . `` And you will get your revenge ! '' he shouted , and with that , he ran away . I walked down the street , and out of the building , and into the woods . I took my time , and waited for the man to come back . I did n't have to wait long . I saw him , and when he came back , I could hear him crying . `` Why did you do that ? '' `` I could n't , '' was all I could say . `` The war is over , '' my voice was weak , and my voice cracked . `` There is no more war . '' It took a long time for me to get back to the house , and for the men to leave . I sat in the dark , and listened to the gunshot . I could feel my heart beating . I felt the blood on my hands , and it was cold , and hard . I heard the screams of the men as they ran by . I wanted to stop them . I was going to stop the war . I would n't let it end like this . I had to stop it . I turned around , and saw the man that had been staring at me stand up . He said , with his eyes full of fear , `` You are going to get your vengeance . '' and then he ran . I watched him run , and watched as he ran from the house . I stood there , and wondered what I would do . I reached the house and looked around . The house was empty , and no one was there . I left the house to go to the woods , and began to walk home . I ran , and ran , but I could not find the man at the door that I was looking for . I kept running , and running , but no one came . I continued on , and finally I reached my home . As I walked home , I saw the door , and in the house was a woman . She was a girl , and she was crying . I stopped and looked her in the eyes . `` Are you okay ? '' she asked . I asked her , `` Are we going to be okay ? I do . '' She looked at my face , and tears started to well up in her eyes . She said , I do , and so I ran . The man with the suit walked out of my house , with me following .	3.494729980957345e-06
`` We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty . '' The voice boomed through the air , echoing across the world . The world was silent , as if it had been a dream . The heavens were silent , and the earth was silent . The earth was quiet . The sun was n't even up yet . `` How did it happen ? '' I asked . `` I do n't know . '' `` It 's been a long time . '' I replied . `` We 've been waiting for this . '' It was a long , long time , but now it was finally here . I was ncano . `` It was n're . '' My mind was racing , and I could n't think of a single word . `` What ? '' `` Hell is empty . We would be happy to announce it . '' That was the last thing I heard . I tried to look around the room . There was no one else there . I could hear the shaking of the earth , but I could still see the people who were still in their homes . I went to the door , and looked out the window . It was dark . The sky was dark , and there was no light . I turned the knob and opened the door . There were people all around me . I looked up , and saw a few people standing in front of me . They were all staring at me . `` Where are you ? '' The man looked at me , and then at the others . `` You 're in hell . '' He said . `` No . '' There was a pause . `` Hell . '' His voice was shaking . `` Please , tell me where you are . '' And then , with a loud bang , he was gone . And I was left alone in the world , alone in Hell . I feel like I was just in a dream , and my mind is still a bit fuzzy . I 'm not sure what I 've done . I have n't seen anyone in a while . I do know that I 'll see them again . I hope . I think I 'd like to see them . I should probably get to work . I need to get out of here . `` Are you okay ? '' asked the man . `` Yes , '' I said . I look at the other people around me , who are all looking at me with the same look of confusion . `` Who are you talking to ? '' They were n't looking at each other . `` Somebody , '' said one of them . `` Someone from Hell . You 've got to be kidding me . '' They looked at each others ' faces , and they all looked at the man in front . He looked at them . He was looking at them , and he looked at himself . `` Hey , I 'mud . ''	3.4943766422657063e-06
The first message was a picture of me , the second was a run . I looked at my phone . `` Run . '' I looked through the messages and saw two messages . `` RUN '' `` Run '' `` RUN . '' `` Where are you ? '' `` We are going to run . '' The second message was , `` Run , run , run . You are going down . '' My heart raced . I could n't believe it . The phone was n't even ringing . I got out of bed and ran out the door . I ran down the street , and ran down one of the streets , but I did n't know where I was going . I had to run to the next street , but that was a long way . I went down a street , I ran to the other side of the street . I saw a person walking down the other road . I did my best to run past , but it was n're he was n' t . I stopped and looked at him . He was wearing a black hoodie . I was n ' t sure what was going on , but he looked like he was wearing some sort of mask . He had a gun on his hip . I pulled my phone out and looked it over . I 'd never seen a picture like this before . I knew what I was doing . I opened the phone . I glanced at the message . `` run '' `` run ... '' I read the message again . I read it again . ``Run '' ``Run ... '' ``run ... '' The message was finally over . ``run '' `` ... '' As I read over the messages I could tell I was in a good place . I began to feel better . I walked over to the man who was standing there . I felt like I was at home . I reached for the gun . `` It 's ok . '' He said . I pushed the gun to my head . `` I 'm sorry , I 'll be right back . '' As he walked away , I looked down at my wrist and saw a picture . It was me . I took a deep breath , and looked up at the man . He looked at me . `` You are n't going to do anything . '' His eyes were wide . He started to cry . `` No . I ca n't . '' And that 's when I saw it . I turned around and saw the gun in his hand . I started to run , and I heard a gunshot . I heard the man screaming . I jumped to the side and ran . I can feel the gun pointing at me , but the gun is n't turning . I look down at the gun and see the gun laying on the ground . I see the man standing there , blood everywhere . `` Get up . ''	3.533793687893194e-06

`` We should not dig here . '' I had been working with archaeologists for a while . I was a young man , I was n't old enough to be a archaeologist , but I had a feeling I was . I had worked with them for years , I 'd heard of them , I had seen them dig , and I knew that they were in the right place . I 've been in the same building for three years now . I saw them dig every day , and they always found the same things . I remember the first time , I heard the first word . It was a man . He was a beautiful man , with a long beard and a balding head . He had a beautiful beard , he was dressed in a suit and tie . He looked like he was in his late twenties . He stood in front of me , and he was smiling . He said something . I did n't understand what he said . `` I 'm sorry , I do n't know what you 're talking about . '' `` I know , but you 've got to be kidding me . You 're not supposed to say that .

I never said that to anyone . I do this every day . I always say it . `` We should n't dig here , '' I said . I just wanted to know why . I thought I was just being stubborn . I could n't believe that I was saying it . I must have been mad . I look at the man , and his face was flushed . `` Do n't be mad . '' he said , `` You ca n't say that to me .

The man looked at me . `` Because I am not mad . You are . '' And he said it . He touched my face , and it was warm . `` That 's why . '' It was cold . I felt it . It felt like I was being kissed . I looked up , and saw a face . It 's face was a woman 's . She was beautiful . It looked like her . Her hair was brown , and her eyes were blue . She had a smile on her face , it was a smile that I had never seen before . `` It 'll be okay , '' she said , and she was smiling at me , `` It will be okay . '' She smiled . I laughed . `` But I do not know what to say . ''	3.4959234653797466e-06
I 'm not sure if I can even describe it . It 's like I 'm in a dark room , and I 've been there . I 'll never know what I 'd do if I was there . It feels like I am in a black hole . I have no idea what I would do if it was n't for the light . I do n't know if I 'M here for the right reasons . I know that I 's here because I 're in a white room . I was natures final test . I am the last human being to ever exist . I ca n't even remember what I was doing when I died . I remember the pain . I can feel the pain , and the nausea . I could n't breathe . I felt like I was being pulled out of my body and I was thrown into the darkness . I saw the light , and then I was pulled back in . I had been pulled out . I did n't see what happened next . I watched the light fade . I looked around the room . There was a room with a door , and it was closed . I knew that I was in the right place . I just did n Dunkin ' Donuts . I ate the donuts .

I put my legs back on the ground . I fell to the ground and I could feel the air rushing by me . I started to cry . I wanted to be dead . But the words came back to me . “ You are not dead . You are in hell . You have died . You will be reincarnated . You can be reborn . You may be reborn again . You might be born again . But you will not be reborn. ” I could see them .

`` We 've been traveling for a long time , '' he said . `` We 're in a new land , and we 're going to find a new home . '' `` That 's not possible , '' I said . He was right . We 'd been traveling a long way . The world was different . We were n't even in the same galaxy . We had n't seen another civilization for over a thousand years . We kept moving , and had n't seen another planet in over a million years . It was all a lie . It 's funny how the world is different when you 're not in it . We thought we were the only ones . We lived in a world that was different , but it was n't . We did n't have the technology to be able to travel in the world , and there were no other races to be found . We could n't find a place to live . We needed to find someone to live in , and I was the only one who could . We went to a village . It had a nice house . We sat there for a while , and talked about the world . We talked about how we could be able at least , if not better than the other races . We decided that we 'd go to the next world , but we had to go to a new place . We wanted to go back to our home . We looked at the world from a different perspective . We saw a world where people lived in peace . We explored the world and met people who were not like us . We met people that were n 't like us , but did n' t have to be like us either . We traveled to a place where we could n ' t be like them . We found a place that was n''t like us and made our way there . We got there and found a nice home . I 'm not sure if it was the same place we lived before , but I remember we had a great life . We stayed there for years . Eventually we decided to move on . We left our home , and made it to a world with a lot of people . We took a ship . We made it up here . We landed on a planet . We tried to find the people , but they were n' even there .

I look at my phone and my fingers are shaking . I check my phone for any messages , and I 'm not sure how to respond . I 've been working on this for two hours . I ca n't get the door to open , and the window to the outside is locked . I do n't know what 's wrong , but I 'll try to get my door open . I leave my phone on the counter , and head to the kitchen . I grab the keys from the counter and go to the front door . I open the door and see a light on . I slowly walk to the door , and feel the cold , metal door creak open . It 's locked . It feels like it 's being pulled open , but it 'll be just as soon as I open it . I reach for the handle , and it 'd be like I 'd been pulling it for years . I push the door open , only to find that it 'm locked . The door is locked , and there 's no way out . I try to open the window , but the door is stuck . I look around for a way out , but there 're no windows . I go to my phone to see if I can get a phone signal , but no one is answering . I start to panic . I turn on the TV , and see that the TV is on , but its off . I move to the desk , and hear a voice say `` Help , my door is sticking , any tips on how to get it open ? '' I have no idea what that means . I walk to my computer , and check the internet . I see a link to a post on Reddit . It was posted by a user called `` The Man Who Can Not Open His Door '' . I click on it , and find a link . I read the link , and read the post , and then I saw that it was from a subreddit called /r/Reddit . I clicked on it . It had over a million upvotes , and over a hundred comments . I have to admit , I was surprised . I did n't even know what to do . I went back to my kitchen , and looked at my door . It still was n't open . * '' Help , I 'M STUCK . '' * I looked around , and saw that the door was locked . My eyes were watering . I looked at the door . And then I noticed the door 's frame was completely broken . I walked back to the living room , and opened the door again . I saw the door still was locked , but not the window . I took a deep breath , and walked back home . I opened the fridge , and found a bottle of water . I drank it , but nothing happened . I tried to open it , only the door stayed locked . And I looked in the fridge . I finally got the door unlocked . I grabbed my phone , and tried to get on the internet again , but my phone was still off . It seemed like I was stuck .	3.6366197946335888e-06
`` It 's the last of the good things in the world ! '' I said as I was walking down the street . I had n't seen her in a long time . She was so pretty , so beautiful . I 'd always wanted to see her , but I had never been able to . I was too scared to ask her out . I saw her , and I knew I could n't do it . She 'd be my best friend , but there was no way I was going to let her see me . I ran into her , saw her . I knew she was beautiful . We walked in silence , and my heart stopped . I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes . I looked at her , she was smiling . She had a beautiful smile . I felt like I could see the world through her eyes . She looked so beautiful , so ... beautiful . `` What do you think , honey ? '' I asked her . She smiled . `` I do n't know , '' she said . She laughed . `` But I 'm sure you will . '' `` What ? '' `` I have to ask you . '' She said . `` Why ? '' She smiled and said , `` I love you . I love that you can see . '' I was in love with her , I could tell . I did n't want to see . I wanted to love her , so I did happy tears . I just wanted to be happy . I loved her , even though I could never see her . `` Do you think you 're going to make it ? '' she asked . `` Not if you do n Thompson . '' she replied . `` You 're not going to be able to see me ? '' This was n't what I wanted . I needed to see people . I ca n't see . She said , I need to see you . `` No , I do . '' My heart stopped , and then it stopped . `` Then you 'll never see me again , '' I whispered . I walked into the house and saw her sitting on the bed . I tried to look away from her , to hide my tears . `` It 'll be okay , '' said Thompson . `` We 'll find you . We 're done . '' He was smiling now . I know that he was nukes . I do too . `` So ... '' I started , but she smiled . She stood up and walked towards me . She put her hand on my shoulder , and said `` I 'll come with you . You 'll know that you 've found me . ''	3.5035532164329197e-06
`` I 'm sorry , but I ca n't teleport . '' `` I know . '' I said . `` I 've been trying to tell you for years . I 'll never get it . '' He said . I was surprised . `` It 's not like you can teleport . I do n't know why you 're so worried . '' This was n't what I expected . `` You 're not worried ? '' I asked . `` No . '' he said . He did n't have to say it . I knew what he was going to say . `` What 's wrong ? '' `` Oh , you know . I just ... I 'd like to teleport . But I ca't . '' His eyes widened . `` Why not ? '' He was napping . `` Because I ' dammit ! I 'VE BEEN TRYING TO TAPER FOR YEARS ! '' I screamed . `` Oh my God ! '' He woke up . `` Do n't worry about it . It 'll be fine . '' We sat down on the park bench , and I took a seat next to him . `` Or ... what ? '' he asked . I sat there , wondering what to say , and he asked me . `` Did you teleport ? '' My eyes widened again . `` Yeah . '' That 's when he started talking . `` Well , I 're ... I can teleport now . '' Then he told me . I started to cry . I could n't believe it . `` Whoa , wait , what ? ! '' `` It was n' t a teleport ! '' he shouted . `` But I did n 't teleport ! I just could n ' t teleport ! You 've never even noticed ! '' We both sat there for a while , and then he spoke . `` If you 've ever tried to teleport , you 'd be dead ! '' His voice was calm and calm . `` There 's nothing to teleport ! It 'd take a whole day to teleport to a different place ! '' But it was n ' then that I realized what I had to do . I put my hand on his shoulder . `` Are you okay ? '' They both looked at me . They were both confused . `` We 're fine . It was just a dream . '' They said . We both started to laugh . `` How did you know ? '' The man who had called me had a smile on his face . `` My friend , you ca n gear up to teleport ? You 'll see . '' And then he disappeared . `` ... What ? ''	3.6687999909190694e-06
`` I 'm not sure if you 're ready to hear this , but I 've got some news for you . '' `` What 's that ? '' `` I 'll tell you what . I 'd like to tell you . I have a new song . '' I said . `` It 's called `` The Sun 's out of Sight '' by the band *Cradle of Gold* . '' The band was playing in the background . I had a very good feeling about it . `` I listen to it . I love it . '' He said . I was sitting there , in the middle of the street , with my mouth open . `` Well , I 's just ... I 'M NOT READY to hear it . It 'll be like a dream . '' My voice cracked , and I had to close my eyes . `` The sun 's OUT of Sight . '' His eyes opened . I could see his face . I heard him smile . `` You 're right . '' We both looked at each other . `` This song is n't for me . '' And then he said , `` I ca n't let you down . '' It was true . `` Why ? '' I asked . `` Because you 've never listened to it before . '' he said . He was right . I knew it was n't the right time . `` But I ' m not ready to listen to the song . I ca insignia . I do n't want to hear the song anymore . '' *Cadle of gold* `` I know you 'll never listen to me . The sun is out of sight . '' There was a long silence . `` If you 'd just listen to this song . It would be like an old song . A song about a dream , but not the one you 's going to listen too . '' So I did n't listen to that song . `` No , I do . '' That was the last time I heard it . We both sat there , staring at each others ' eyes . I took a deep breath . `` So , I know I 're not ready for this . I know that you 'm never going to tell me . But I will . '' -- - `` I do too . I just want you to know that I ' Mi- '' `` Do you want to listen ? '' He asked . I nodded . `` What ? '' My mouth was dry . `` Do n't . '' This time I did . `` Just listen . ''	4.460531727090711e-06
`` So you know , '' she said , `` I was thinking about it . '' `` I do n't know , I do . I guess I 'm just not sure what to think about it , '' he said , still looking at her . `` I mean , I mean ... I mean it 's not like I have to think of anything . '' She looked at him , and he looked at her , and they both knew what he was thinking . `` It 's so simple . '' He said . `` Do you know what I mean ? '' She said . He looked at the floor , and to his surprise , he saw a small piece of paper . `` Really ? '' `` Yes , '' She was shocked . `` You know , you 're right . You know it 'll be fine . '' And so he said . She looked up at him . `` What ? '' He asked . `` How do you know ? '' she asked . He thought he knew . `` Well , '' He answered . `` That 's when I noticed it . I mean I knew it was coming . '' The girl was shocked , and not in a good way . She was so shocked that she did n't say anything . She just stood there , and looked at a piece of white paper , and then she looked at his face . `` Oh , '' was all she could say . She did n Banked . He knew what she was thinking , and she knew it . She thought he was cheating . He was n't cheating . And she thought he did n couple of things . She knew he was nid- . `` But , '' the girl said , and for the first time in her life she was scared . `` He 's cheating . '' '' I know . '' he thought . He 'd seen it before . He saw her . The girl who had been a beautiful maiden , by day , by night , a beautiful woman who looks different . He had seen her in the mirror . He always knew , but he never told her . He did n 't want to hurt her . She had been his wife . She 'd been his daughter . He could n't stand it . He wanted to get out of the house , and leave her . But she was n' she was his daughter , and her father was n ' he had been her husband . He would n't leave her alone . He felt like he was a murderer . He wondered what she would do to him if he left her . And he was going to do it .	3.492471250865492e-06
`` I 'm glad you are here , '' I said . `` I 've been waiting for you . '' He looked at me with a grin . `` Well , I 'll tell you . I 'd like to show you around . '' I watched him with a smile . `` Do n't be afraid . '' `` What ? '' I asked , `` I was just wondering if I should tell you about the place I live . '' The man smiled back . `` It 's a nice place . '' With a nod , he took my hand . `` You 'll see . '' My heart was beating faster . `` Now , I know you 're here for a reason . '' A smile . I was n't sure why . `` Because I 's here to show me around . I want to show how it 's done . '' His smile faded . `` What do you mean ? '' `` Well ... '' He said , `` You have n't seen anything like this before . '' As if I were n't already aware of the place . `` Is it really the same ? '' He asked . `` No . '' That was the last thing I heard . I did n't know what to say . `` Oh , I do n't think it 'll be the same . '' he said , staring at me . `` Just go on . '' And I did . I walked down the hall . `` This place is the same as any other place in the world .

I 'm not sure how it happened , but I guess I was in the closet . I 'm sure I did n't know it was there . I was n't sure if I was dreaming , or if it was real . I do n't remember waking up in the morning , or even waking up at all . I think I was just sleeping in . I just know that I was . I remember the smell of the floor , the smell that was so familiar , the way the air smelled . I could hear the crackling of the fire , the soft , raspy sound of the wood , the sound of my feet on the floor . I knew that I had to move out . I did . I had a new roommate . He was a monster . I know that now . I woke up in my bed , and I was so confused . I tried to go back to sleep . I should have just gone to the bathroom . I got up . I went to my closet . Just as I was about to leave , I heard a soft , soft , dull thud . I turned around , and there was a dark figure standing in my closet , staring at me . I saw him . He looked just like me , and he was wearing the same clothes as I did , except he was covered in blood . He had a large , black , red , and white suit . I looked around for the source of the sound . I thought I was going to die . I ran to the closet , and looked around . I found him . I screamed . I realized that I could n't breathe . I started to cry . I dropped the sword I had been holding in my hands . I fell to the ground , and started to sob . I felt the pain in my chest , and the pain of the blood . I heard the sound again . I opened my eyes , and saw the monster . He seemed to be looking at me , as if he had seen me . He said , `` You 're not going to kill me . '' He was right . I look up at the ceiling , and see the fire . I feel the pain . I try to stand . I can feel the blood coming from my body . I see the light of the sun , and it burns me . The light of my life . I fall . I have to get out of here . I run out of the closet and into the street . I am so afraid . I ca n't wait to get away . I hear the door open . I turn around and see a man . He is wearing a suit , and is wearing the clothes I was wearing . He has a small red hat . He looks like me . `` Hello , '' he says . I say , `` I 've been waiting for you . '' `` I know , '' I say . `` I have been waiting . '' I try and walk away . `` You are going to have to move . '' The man said . `` No , '' said the man . `` Please . ''	3.519587380651501e-06
The world is a cruel place . The government has taken control of our lives and it is now the responsibility of the majority of us to make sure that no one ever gets the chance to do anything wrong . The people of this world have been under the rule of the government for centuries . They have been given the power to decide what they want to do with their lives . They are now the most powerful people on the planet . They can do anything they want , they can do whatever they want . They do n't need to be rich or powerful , they are just the most intelligent . But they can be the most destructive . They could destroy the very foundation of the world . They were the first to do so . They stole the first few billion dollars from their parents . They took their parents ' savings and used it to buy a house . They used their parents to buy themselves a car , a house , a dog , and a house of their own . They then used their money to buy everything else . They ran the world and they were the most evil people on earth . They did n't have to worry about being the smartest or the most beautiful or the smartest . They just had to be the smartest and the most dangerous . They would use their money and they would use it to do whatever the government wanted . The world was a cruel and destructive place . They had no choice but to destroy themselves . They destroyed themselves . But that was n't the only reason why they were so powerful . They also destroyed themselves by destroying their children . They killed their children and they killed their grandchildren . They even killed their great grandchildren . It was a sad and sad world . We were the last people to die . We could n't stop them . They came back and they took everything they wanted from us . They condemned us to a life of misery . They slaughtered us . We had to die to survive . We did noult the best we could , we had to fight back . We fought back and we won . We won . But we did nforces of nature , our ancestors , and we took the world by storm . We took everything we could . The first to die were the ones who had the most money . We gave them the money . They gave us the most power . The last to die was the one who was the most important . They made the most of their money . The second to die , they took their children 's money . So they killed them . The third to die did nt have to die at all . They brought them back to life . They turned them into the most successful people in the world , the most wealthy people in history . They created the greatest weapons of war . They built weapons that could destroy all the world 's weapons . They smashed the world with the power of their hearts . They called them `` bullets '' . They shared their power with the world as they did the world in war . The war was fought for the sake of the people . They fought for their lives , they fought for what they wanted . They attacked the world for their power . They wanted to take everything they had . They tried to destroy the world to get what they had , and they did naught . They won . And they were n't alone .	3.5320485949341673e-06

`` The robots are a dangerous business . '' The man said , pointing at the robot in the middle of the room . `` This one was built in the '50s . It 's been built by a man who was a master of the arts , and has been working on it for hundreds of years . It was made by a few of his brothers in the past , but he was n't a very good one . He died at the age of 34 . '' `` And he 's still alive ? '' `` No , he 'm still alive . '' I said . `` So he 'll be here for hundreds more years .

`` I 've been trying to make this a thing for a while now . I 'm not sure why . '' I said to the boy , his face pale . He had a nervous look on his face . `` I 'll tell you what , I 'd like to take you to the park . '' He said , and I nodded . `` Of course . '' `` I do n't want to go , '' I replied . `` But I 's not sure I want to stay here . '' My voice was quiet , and he was quiet .

I did n textbooks , I did not want him to be worried about me . `` Do n't worry , '' he told me , and then he turned to the sky . `` We 're not going to die .

It was nn't a question . `` Just like the government ca n 1983 , '' and it was n n't a word . `` And we caoutinely deny them access to it . They ca in the government . '' The judge looked at thePaper . `` But we ca't stop it ! '' `` It is n't illegal , you know , '' `` But it is n1983 , '' my voice was shaking . `` This is n't illegal , it 's just a big deal . '' She looked down . `` Why ca n283 ? '' The court was silent . `` Because it 'll be illegal . It 'll never be legal . '' It was then that I saw the news . The world was going to be in chaos . The president was going insane . `` There 's no way it 'd be legal , '' they said . There 'd been a massive uproar . `` No , there 's n't . '' They were right . `` That 's the problem , you have to stop this . '' But I was no longer able to say anything , and the judge looked back at me . `` Are you sure ? '' He looked at my face . `` Yes . '' We were n't going to stop . `` Then why ca n2013 ? ''	3.490573135422892e-06
I 'm not sure what to do with myself . I 'm a man of many feelings , and I 've been a man for a long time . I had a wife , a daughter , and a son . I was a man 's man . I thought I was good at everything . I loved my family , my friends , my job , my life . I made friends , I had my family . I felt like a man . But I was not . I did not love myself . Every time I thought of her , I felt a wave of sadness . She was my life , and it was n't fair . I could not love her , and she was my world . I tried to make it work . I wanted her to be happy . I knew I could n't . I would n't be able to be with her . I never could . I always thought I knew , but I could never . I still did n't know . I turned to her , but she was gone . I think I was in the bathroom . I looked at my hands , and saw the blood that had been there for the past three months . I saw the knife . I heard her voice . `` I 'll be back . '' I heard a voice . I froze . I recognized her voice , but it was different . I can not remember her voice anymore . It was the voice of my wife . She came into the room , and sat down next to me . She looked at me , and then at the knife , and back at me . I came to my senses . I cried . I fell to the floor , and lay there . I have no idea how long I was there . She yelled at me to get up . I stood up , and walked to the bathroom , and looked at the blade . I took a deep breath , and held it in my hand . I held it to my chest , and felt my heart rate rise . I reached for the blade , and pulled it out . I swung it at her . The blade hit her head , and her head fell to her knees . I let out a scream . I screamed and threw the blade in her face . I watched as she fell to my knees , and my heart sank . I lost her . She died . I woke up , still crying . I started crying . And I was crying . She sat on my bed , and cried with me . Her body was covered in blood . I broke down , and sobbed . I begged her to stop . She did n not . She laid there , and kissed me , then she went to the kitchen , and took the knife out of my hand , and stuck it into her mouth . I died .	3.521393637129222e-06
I was on the train , looking up at the stars . I could n't believe my eyes , they were so bright and bright . The sky was so clear , and the moon was so bright . My eyes were so full of wonder , I could barely see the stars in the distance , they seemed so far away . I was so excited . I had never been on a train before , I had always been a little scared of trains . But this was different . I only had to look up and I could see the moon . The train was so big , and so bright , and I felt like I could touch it . I looked at the moon , and it was so beautiful . I laughed , and then I saw it . It was a beautiful , beautiful blue . I knew it was beautiful . It came from the sky , and was so small , and beautiful . The sun was shining down on me , and when it was right above me , I felt so happy . I felt the wind on my face , and my heart was beating so fast . I did n't feel like I was going to die , but I felt happy . It felt like a dream . The light was so light , and there were so many things to see . I wished that I could have seen the sun . I wanted to see the sun on the moon so bad , but it was too bright . I wish I could make it out of this train , and see the world . I want to see it so much . I do n't want to go back to the train . I know I will . I will go back . I have to go . I am going to see everything . I just want to be with my friends . I need to see them . I love them . They are so beautiful , and they are so wonderful . I can see them now . I 'm going to go home . I ca n't wait . I must be with them . My heart is beating so hard , I ca remission . I think I will be with the world , and will see it again . I hope I can make it back . My mind is racing . I feel so happy , and happy . The world is so beautiful in the moonlight . I see the sky so bright ! I see it ! I can feel it ! It 's so beautiful ! I ca N' t believe it ! The sun is so bright now , and is so big ! I love it ! My heart has been beating so quick , and now I am so happy ! I do not want to die ! I want my friends to see me , but the world is too bright ! My eyes are so bright too ! I am happy ! This is so amazing ! I have never been so happy in my life ! I will see them again ! I hope they are happy .	3.4937302189064212e-06
I 've been doing this for so long . I 've worked with the most evil people , the most despicable people in the world . I was a villain for so many years , and I was n't even aware that I was the only one . I could n't help it . I had to be the bad guy . I knew it . Everyone knew I was , but I never thought I would feel this way . I mean , I 'm not the best at it , but it 's just not something I can control . I have to be a good guy . My life is n't perfect . I ca n't do this . I do n't know why . I should n't have to do this , but ... I do . I know what I have done . I need to be good . I just ca n 't . I can not . I am not good . It 's not right . I did n't mean to do it . It was n' t my fault . I never meant to do anything like this . It ca n't be right . It just is n' it 'll be right , I swear . I will n't die . I wo n't be a monster . I want to be ... I want it to be right ! I want my life to be perfect . It should be . I really do . But it 'm n't . I still have to go . I guess I 'll go . They 'll believe me . I swear I will . I hope . I wish I could be good , but for what ? I 'd rather die . They can believe me , but they 're not . They ca n’ t . I ’ m not good enough . I don ’ t want to . I think I 're a monster , but that 's for the best . I feel like I ' m a monster when I 's in this state . I hate my life . I live it for the people . I hated my life for the first time in years . I wanted to be bad , but now I 'Meme me . It ’ s time to end it . If I do , I can never be good again . I love them . I used to . But I am n't good enough anymore . I always wanted to kill them . They are so good . They were my friends . They saved me . They made me feel like a real person . I loved them . But they never loved me . Not anymore . They never loved anyone . They only loved themselves . They would n't love me anymore . That 's why I ca't kill them anymore . It is n ' t right . They should be happy . I made them happy . They could be happy , but not for me . That is n'm I . I must be good enough to stop them . It has to be . It must be . They still love me . But ... I 'fucking hate them . No . They love me , and they hate me . And they hate themselves . I would n' be good for them . So , I guess it 're time to do something about it .	3.605543952289736e-06
`` You 're a dragon , you 're the only one who could have done it . '' The King said . `` I 'm a dragon . I 've been fighting this war for the past three months . I have been fighting for my life . I can not let this go on any longer . '' `` You 've got to be kidding me . '' I said . The King had been watching me for the last three months , he could n't believe it . `` You have to be serious ! '' I replied . `` They 're your only chance . '' He said . I thought he was mad . `` Fuck you . '' he said . He was right . I knew he was right , and I was right too . The war had gone on for three months now . `` Why are you here ? '' I asked . `` Because I 'll show you what I can do . '' ** '' I 'd like to see you , '' I told him . `` And I 'VE GOT TO SHOW YOU ! '' He shouted . `` That 's not what I wanted . I was just trying to help . '' * '' I know . You 'll be fine . '' said the King . `` What ? '' `` I have to show you . I need to show this court what I 'M capable of . '' My hands were shaking . `` Do you have any idea what I do ? '' The king asked . I shook my head . `` No . '' Said the King , `` You do n't . '' Then he said , `` I want you to show me . You have been a dragon for the next three months ! '' `` Thats not fair ! '' said I . `` But you have to . '' And with that he said that he would show me what he could do . `` Now I have a case to prove . '' Suddenly I could n THREE dragons . I had no idea what to do . I could see the King 's face . He looked like he was about to cry . `` Well , I 're going to show them . '' As I said that I put my hand on the King and looked him in the eyes . `` This is your chance . I do n’ t know how long you 've had to wait for this . '' This time he looked at me . `` Three months ? '' He asked . He had a look of fear in his eyes . I looked at him . He nodded . `` Then I ' will show you how to do it . You can show them , '' he whispered . `` If you show me how to , '' said my lawyer . `` The King has already shown me . I will show them how to . I want to show him the way . ''	3.5746991216001334e-06

She would have to find a way to leave , to do whatever it took to get away from this place . She knew that he would be there , but she was n't sure if she could do it . She did n't want to be alone . She wanted to be happy . She tried to be brave , to get up and go to work , to try to be someone else . She thought that she could run away from the place , but it was n 't really that hard . She found her way to the local library , where she found the only way out of the place was to go to a nearby park . She walked into the park , and there he was . He was standing on the bench , with his back to her , with a smile on his face . He smiled back at her , and she smiled back . He looked at her with a look of pure joy . He did n ’ t say anything , but he knew she was going to ask . He took her hand and pulled her closer . She felt the warmth of his hand on her cheek , and could feel the warmth radiating from his fingers . She looked at him , and he smiled . He moved his hand to her face , and then it was gone . He gave her a kiss , and they were gone . Jane was alone , and that was that . She didn ’ T want to go back . She hated this place , and was n’ t sure if it was worth it . None of this was worth the risk , but Jane had to go . She got in her car , and drove away . She drove for hours , and finally reached her destination . She sat down in the parking lot , and looked at the sky . She took a deep breath , and closed her eyes . She opened them , and saw the sun setting . She remembered the last time she had seen him . She smiled . She wished she had . She pulled out her phone , and dialed the number . She waited for a few seconds , and picked up the phone . She said , “ Hello ? ” . “ Jane ? “ I ’ m here , ” he said . ” Hello ? I ” m , ’ I ‘ m Jane. ” “ Yeah , ‘ Jane ? I know you ’ re here , and I “ m , sorry. ’ ” She said . She hung up the call , and put the phone down . She stood up , and opened the door . She went to the kitchen , and started to pour herself a cup of coffee . She turned to the floor , and waited . She put her hand on the table , and pulled out a small black box . She picked up a small piece of paper , and starting to read it . ‘ This is a letter from the state of Michigan , from the Department of Health , to the Department Of Human Services . I am sorry , and you are in the wrong place . Please come back . ’ She was confused . She wrote the letter , and it was on the floor . She held it up , but could n‘ t read it , because it was in a book , and the words were too heavy . She read it over and over , and thought about it , and wrote back . It was a letter of apology . She told him that she was sorry , she was so sorry . She started to cry , and so did he . She cried until she was sobbing . She asked him if he would like to come back , and when he said yes , she put the letter on the ground . She ran back to the house , and left . She made her way home . She kept walking , and walked home .	3.60396597898216e-06

`` I 'm sorry , I ca n't help you . '' I said . `` It 's my fault . '' `` It was n't my fault you died . '' He said . I looked at him . I was n Richmond . I had been there . I knew him . He was the one who killed me . I 'd seen him in the mirror . I could see the tears in his eyes . He could n't even look at me . He did n't look like he was smiling . I did n t feel like I was . `` You 're the reason I 've been haunting this place for the last few weeks . '' My heart skipped a beat . I managed to get out , `` You were n't supposed to be here .

The king looked at the man sitting on the ground , a man who was obviously dead . The man had been shot in the head . He was the only one that had survived the siege , but the man had not been dead for long . His face was covered in blood , but he was still alive . `` How long have you been here ? '' The king asked . The thief had no answer . He had been dead before . `` I do not know . I have been dead since I was a child , '' the man replied . `` You have been a king for the past ten years , '' he said . The king had been sleeping for the last ten years . He did not know how long he had been here . The only thing he knew was that he was going to die . He looked at his wife , who was now dead , and the man in the king 's arms . The King was still sleeping . `` It is not the end of the world , '' said the man . The guard stood up and walked towards the king . `` But , '' asked the king , `` what do you think about it ? '' `` It was a long time ago . '' `` I 'm sorry , '' replied the thief . `` What ? '' the king asked , `` What do you mean ? '' He was now standing next to the king and the guard . `` The king is dead . I was shot in his bed . '' The man 's face was now covered in a mixture of blood and the blood of the king himself . `` He was killed by the king when he was a young boy . '' He said . `` And the king was killed when he tried to save him . '' It was then that the king saw the man he had killed . He realized that the man was dead , because he had not killed him . `` Why ? '' asked The King . `` Because he was dead . '' said The King , `` Because I was afraid . '' And the man 'S face was still covered in the blood . `` Yes . '' the thief said . He took the King 's hand , and they walked away from the castle . `` This is the last time I will ever see you , '' The King said . -- -- -- - Thanks for reading !

There was a battle held in stillness , in memory , Lofted the standard of a enemy mine , The outstretched hand appearing like grace . Heroics of war are truly a forgery . After the bodies are gathered , suspended in brine . He is left bereft with out a place , Hounded by the shades of eternity , For home has forgotten the truth of his face . There is whisper of the sands of time . He goes to places seeped in despair and lechery . One night he is sick of dreams and abandons the brace , Staggers to a darkened shrine . There is a nunnery with silent bells Here is where the cold knight fell .	0.9999959468841553
`` I do n't understand you Charles . You have this woman practically begging for you to take her back to your flat , '' Austin took a drag from his cigarette , `` and you do n't capitalize . '' He released the puff of smoke out with a quick breath . `` I mean honestly , why do we go out if you 're just gunna fuck it up ? '' He motioned at the nearby waitress in a violent flick of the wrist , `` Christ we are the only ones here and no service . '' The waitress approached , her name tag read Linda , carrying a small pad with small sweat stains on the edge from her fingers clutching it . `` Good morning ! What will it be then ? '' She said in an ostensibly cheerful tone even though the bags under her eyes were telling them to fuck off . `` Right then , I 'll have the number 2 , burn the bacon black . '' Austin said without eye contact and jerked the folded menu and waited for the woman to release him of the burden of holding it . `` The same . '' Charles said in such a soft response that surprised Linda , the career waitress . `` Well ? Are you gunna tell me what happened ? '' Austin threw his hands in the air without his elbows leaving the table , as if they were glued to the surface . `` Tell you what ? '' Charles responded , looking out the window to the empty parking lot , knowing this would anger Austin . `` You know fucking what . Why the fuck did n't you take her home ? '' Austin 's arms flopped onto the table , making the clutter of salt shakers and ketchup bottles clink . `` I am not so sure myself . '' Charles said still staring out the window . `` Do you ever ... '' He started , but knew that asking Austin might be a mistake . `` Do I ever what ? '' Austin said halfheartedly while using his straw as a toothpick . `` Do you ever think about The One ? '' Charles quietly asked bracing himself for whatever carp Austin would throw his way . `` Like a soul mate ? '' Austin asked , clearly caught off guard by the weight of the question . `` Yeah like a soul mate . Someone that you are destined to be together with . Someone that makes the earth quake beneath your feet . The air becomes thicker and harder to breath . The lights in the room seem to follow them . '' Charles realized how ridiculous he was being , `` You know all that sappy shit . '' `` No , Charles , '' He said in a mocking tone , `` I do not believe in a soul mate . '' Austin reclined in the booth seat and put his arms across the back , `` That shit is all made up . Its all chemistry . Whether you find someone who can withstand smelling your pheromones all day long without gagging . '' He then leaned forward on the table pointing directly at Charles , `` And there ai n't only one person for someone . That load of bull the romantics spew to give their life purpose . It 's shit and you know it . '' `` Why would I ask if I knew it already Austin ? '' Charles quipped , knowing that this would , again , make him irritated . `` Charles , do you honestly believe that there is only one person out there for everyone ? Then , how the fuck are all these people getting married ? Their one true loves , they just happen to work at the same fucking company as they do ? They just happen to live in the same city ? Same country ? Same fucking continent ? Its a load of bull and you know it . People pretend that they have these unique standards that only one person can fill . Bull . Why is it that a person moving to an entirely new part of the world can make friends ? It is n't because they lucked out and found the only 5 people that check off their list . It is because people crave shit like that . They will make friends with people they would have never been friends with before then simply because they need friends not because it was destined . The same goes for this soul mate shit . People can just delude themselves that this person is entirely unique and no one could replace them but they are dead wrong . That other bloke across the bar could fill the same needs too only he grew up slightly different , so at Christmas they leave out doughnuts for ol ' saint Nick not cookies . '' Austin exclaimed with a whirlwind of hand gestures . `` So you are saying that people all are the same at the core . Their background just fills in the minor details that determines whether you are attracted to them or not ? '' `` Were you fucking listening ? I am saying that finding someone that you could spend the rest of your life with is n't hard . Their upbringing , their shit of a childhood is just filler . People crave other people . Were are social and political animals . '' He took another drag of his cigarette . `` What about those people who spend every second of every day together . Those people who have been together since they were five years old ? '' Charles asked actually intrigued by Austin 's thoughts on this . `` Fucking hell man , they simply got lucky . They were just similar enough that their pheromones resonated more with each other . '' Austin scoffed as if it was obvious . `` So you would n't call them soul mates , you would just say they got lucky in the person they chose to give their life to ? '' `` Exactly . Marriages , civil unions whatever the fuck these kids are up to now a days is just how you formally say that you are willing to give your life to someone because you find them a functioning human being with some sort of value . '' `` What about those who do n't have any value ? '' Charles was purposefully playing devils advocate here . Testing Austin to see if he could corner himself in his own ideas . `` Those are the spinsters man . No one found them suitable to give their life to them . They did n't show they were successful enough or responsible enough or some shit . Why the fuck do you care so much about this anyway ? '' Austin lowered an eyebrow and finished his cigarette . `` I do n't know . After last night , I have been wondering if we are destined to be with someone . To share our life with someone else in the universe or if we are simply alone . A bunch of star dusts formed into sacks of meat . Getting each other off by rubbing together and shooting DNA at each other to create equally fucked up meat sacks . Then withering away back into dust . Waiting to take shape again . '' Charles stared off into seemingly another world . `` What the fuck , man . What happened last night ? ''	0.9999949932098389
**April 5th 1942 : ** I am so excited to finally be in England . I had no idea that the ship would take that long . I am just thankful that our crew were able to get to our airfield and be assigned to our plane . Lt Caulfield has decided to call our plane `` Lucky Lucy , '' we even painted a naked girl on the side of the plane . I have only been here for a day , met the First Sergeant and all , he seems nice ; he always said that if we need help , he 's there for us . I wish I could go into London , it seems so close but the First Sergeant says its off limits until its safe . This place seems so amazing , I ca n't wait to fly and see the whole world from my turret ! **April 23rd 1943 : ** Tomorrow is the fiftieth . Finally , fifty fucking missions and I get out of the cloudy shit hole . `` Lucky Lucy '' my ass , she 's lucky because she gets plugged every fucking other day . My damned turret jammed on me again yesterday , I swear if Griggs does n't fix it , I 'm going to throw him out over Germany myself . We hit Bremen again , I swear the wing king has a crush on fucked planes , crews and flak . Caulfield was killed yesterday , they gave us some green fucker fresh out of flight school ; pompous little fuck . Whatever , tomorrow is my last flight and I can go the fuck home . Next time I pen this thing , I should be pitching everything in a duffel .	0.0006012769299559295
`` Hey , you really should n't be getting drunk . It ca n't be good for your hands . '' I did n't want to hear her . Or maybe I just did n't want to see her . Probably both . Actually , I just did n't want to remind myself -- to remind myself to regret . `` Look , you 're already out of whiskey ! Do n't reach for the vodka , that 's a cheap brand . '' I did n't care . Ethanol is ethanol . Same kind I 've been drinking for three years . I lifted myself off the recliner and to the bottle across the room . One step at a time , one step -- `` I told you not to drink , you ca n't even walk straight . '' I held back in my vomit as I struggled to stand . My hand groped around for support before it grabbed onto the kitchen counter . `` Please be careful . '' With a heave I tried to raise myself before my hand slipped ; my hand knocking over a stray shot glass . Alcohol-thinned blood and glass lacerations . Not a good combo . `` Oh no -- no no no . There 's bandages in the bathroom , where they 've always been . '' No , I could n't get up . I was too drunk , tired , and depressed . My blurred vision set onto my bloodied hand . My left hand . Not often you find left-handed surgeons . I was such a promising doctor too . How many patients ? Hundred at least . Everyone still seems to think I 'm *the* doctor though . A legendary surgeon . Bullshit . The blood ran down my hand , coalescing around my ring finger . Around my engagement ring . `` Please , please , please get up . '' No , I just could n't do it . I rested my head against the cabinet handles . Actually , my hands remind of when I murdered my first patient . So much blood , and so much fear . It was such a long time ago . I still remember . But I do n't remember the time . I do n't remember the day . I do n't even remember the hospital or the assistants . I only remember , that when her heart stopped , so did mine . I looked up . No point in avoiding a ghost . `` Do n't try to remember from three years ago ! Forget about my dad ! I was too far gone ! Please , please , fix your hand first . We can sort out everything else later . Please ... It was n't your fault , do n't try to remember . It was 27 stab wounds ! '' Ah , that 's the age when my heart stopped . `` You were n't even at the hospital at the time ! I would n't have made it in an ambulance either ! Please , just move on ! '' Oh yeah . The tools I had at the time were a dinner knife and a fork . `` P-please . '' She started crying . The ghost started crying . If she could hold onto something , she probably would 've held onto me . Like she usually did . `` I love you . I love you so much . So please , move on . '' Huh . 'So please ' is what she said to me that day . Her last words . I could feel the tears running down my cheeks . `` So please , live for me . '' Yeah . I remember everything . She was the only patient to die under my scalpel . Her diagnosis was 27 stab wounds to the chest , abdomen , and throat . The time was 13:00 . Three years ago , I saw her bigot father run through the church and mutilate her . He was n't even invited . 'If she was n't his baby girl then no one can have her . ' I tried to save her , but all I had were the wedding utensils and a couple of gaping wounds . My phone rang . It was one of the nurses . `` Doctor , there 's an emergency patient . There 's no doctors on-site -- '' `` Sorry nurse . I 'm drunk . ''	0.9786587953567505
Joe Warshborn pulled out a set of keys from a secret compartment in the trash can . There was hundreds of them , all tinkling and shimmering in the dim lighting . The metallic clink they made calmed his nerves . He never knew what to expect with the new villains . The keys were his weapons , though . He eyed ball the man behind the bars . Water streamed down the walls around a tall and heavy chested figure . Strong legs lounged in front of him without a care as the villain eye balled the scruffy man back . He seemed confused . `` So who are you ? '' He sneered at Joe 's janitor 's uniform , but seemed interested in the keys . They are always interested in the keys . Joe walked past their cells a hundred times , but they only seem to notice he existed when he pulled out the keys . Even then , they only pay attention to the keys . The villain 's eyes never focused on his face . Which is what Joe preferred in these type of situations . The janitor grimaced and started fiddling through the keys . He did n't often come out this way , so finding the right key took a few more seconds . His tired eyes looked up , and he scratched his scraggly beard . He held up the correct key in satisfaction so the villain could see . `` They call me The Keymaster . '' `` Are you a villain ? '' He shook my head , and quietly unlocked the heavy door . `` No , I just release them . '' `` Why ? You a hero then ? '' Joe noted the red flames shimmering almost invisible on the villain 's skin and backed away prudently . That explains why he was in the back rooms , and the walls of water . Less flammable that way . `` Nope . Just a neutral party . You are free to go , and I suggest you head out quickly . There are cameras who will notice there is a missing body . '' Joe waved vaguely towards the exit . The fire man hesitated , but freedom always took precedence with villains . Flames bursted in preparation in his hands as he jogged turn the corridor . Joe sighed and pushed his cleaning cart in the opposite direction , shaking his head in disappointment . Kids these days never said thanks anymore . The wheels squeaked pleasantly in the dim lighting and soon he heard the sirens call into the night . They knew the fire man was gone . Not his problem though . He still had to clean the guards bathroom before calling it a night , and dispose of the trash . As Joe stepped into the bathroom , he heard a polite cough from the back . One of the newer interns from The League of Awesome Heroes stood awkwardly next to the stalls . Joe stopped , and looked expectedly at him . The young hero posed dramatically . `` Uhm , good citizen ! Are you the man known as Keymaster ? '' Joe glanced around the empty bathroom , down at his janitors uniform , and back at the awkwardly confident man . `` I can neither confirm nor deny that . '' This seemed to deflate the hero 's enthusiasm . `` Oh , well , okay . I have a package for you . The Keymaster . Which is you . Right ? '' The janitor shrugged amicably and held out his hand , `` Let 's just say I am not surprised to see you here . '' With a sniff , the hero dumped the package down onto Joe 's wrinkled palm and unceremoniously dove out the window . Joe carefully weighed the package , and nodded approvingly . Another two years of this , he should be able to retire . With a whistle , the Keymaster began mopping down the floors .	0.9999698400497437

When I was 6 I summoned Adolf Hitler , he was about to shoot himself but then he realised where he was . Now , 14 years later the fourth reich is going well , the state of knowledge was deemed medieval by Adolf , but 14 years later and a lot of nazi scientists/engineers summoned . The enitre country is being modernized , culture is booming , shows and plays and radioes are a hit . Train rails are being placed down everyday connecting us to the great capital Berlin . At the beginning it was tough , we had to rally the people to work for us which was n't easy . But after reviving entire panzer divisions we murdered all lords and kings . Reinstating them with city workers who control city development . All in all people abandoned the ways of old and I became the emperor . They all put down their swords in defeat knowing that I ca n't be defeated . We are now going to teleport me to WW2 Berlin so I get to be shot and can revive myself . Eternal life in this empire does n't sound so bad . Especially considering we can only go forward , united at last .	0.9999474287033081
The Vegetarians thought they had failed , that nothing had changed after Operation Evolved Cow seemingly had gone nowhere . What nobody understood was that the cow is a patient animal , an animal that understands it 's limitations . Oh if a bull ran off and gored a bunch of humans that might make the news , but that would n't truly change anything . The system had to be subverted , humanity had to be brought to heel , and the cows needed to harness their greatest weapon for that . They struck only the farms they lived on at first . Few people noticed the local farmers now had a glassy , almost dead look in their eyes . Some people complained but nobody could put two and two together . Cows were masters of the prion and now it did their dark work for them . When enough of the world 's food supply was under their control they finally unleashed their great weapon upon the world . Mad Cow Disease ripped through the world like a wildfire . For the vast majority of humanity , a horrible , agonizing death was their fate . They were the lucky ones . The cows knew not all of humanity would eat their tainted flesh and be corrupted , so a select few of those who did had to be kept alive , controlled by the prion that tore apart their brains to purge the world of the remainder of humanity . We call them cow-pokes . It 's not a very creative name but it fits what they do . Slow witted , not good at aiming a weapon , but they do n't sleep and they are quiet , freakishly quiet . Still they are the enemy you would rather face . It 's the Bovine Brotherhood that 's the real threat . At some point the Vegetarians admitted to what they did , some of them sought to stop it , but others decided that they had only gotten the job most of the way done and now they were there to see it completed . Proving one is a Vegetarian is pretty impossible so the Brotherhood kills first and asks questions later . I half think most of them are lying about their eating habits and they just sold out to get on the winning side . The cows tolerate them because the really ca n't drive cars or work the internet , but lord knows with all the gene splicing that might change soon enough . Fighting a Brotherhood patrol is bad enough , but if they call for backup . It 's usually five hundred plus pounds of pure death . A beast genetically altered to absorb more damage then you would think possible . Skull and horns that splinter bones like they were balsa wood . The legs on those monsters do n't cave in your chest , they kick through it . Me and my group lucked out , living in Maui kept us isolated from the main land and once we 'd heard about the cow-pokes we made sure that every victim of Mad Cow Disease met a fatal end . There 's no Brotherhood here , no idea if they 'll come , but we 'll be ready if they do . These are the Dark Times . This is the Cow Wars .	0.9999654293060303
* “ Ladies and gentlemen of Earth , I come before you on this most historic occasion…* The recording had been playing on repeat across every channel for the past week . Inside the cramped smoky tavern someone reached their limit . A glass soared over Jason ’ s head to smash against the steel mesh enclosing the screen . Jason chuckled as the bartender threw a towel at the perpetrator and threatened to end his night , and his life , if the television broke . * “ …have worked tirelessly with your leaders across the planet to ensure a swift and pleasant… ” * The man sitting to Jason ’ s left let out a grunt . “ Damn grey-skins , think they can come down here and take our planet , hell no , fuck ‘ em all , I say. ” Jason nodded along . The ‘ grey-skins ’ as he had named them had landed on Earth several months previously , bearing gifts and promises of paradise amongst the stars . * “ …welcome your species into the Federation , where you will be elevated to respected vassals… ” * Jason unconsciously rubbed his jaw , the scar from the plasma bolt having faded to a sickly mottled red . He was sure the greys had expected a fanfare , coming from a species with a pop culture so deeply vested in science fiction . But no , humanity doesn ’ t like change . * ” …forgiven of all past transgressions and welcomed with open arms . Enlightenment is upon you , Humanity , how will you… ” * It had ended as quickly as it had begun . How could we have expected to hold out against an invader capable of faster-than-light travel ? Like dominos , the armies of Earth had fallen . * ” …join us among the stars , and together we might experience… ” * To be honest , life under their watchful eyes wasn ’ t too bad ; crime was dropping , food was plentiful , at least what they passed for food , disease was on the way out , hell , they would even house you in their colony camps . At least , that was the image they presented . * ” …however , I must reiterate ; there are those among your species who do not agree with the proposed integration… ” * Jason knew the truth . He had been to the camps , he had seen the horrors , the experiments . For all the self-aggrandizing they spouted , their conquerors were far from benevolent . * ” …and so I appeal to you , the populace . If you know an instigator , or anyone who has not seen the light that we offer… ” * The doors of the tavern swung open , and every head swiveled . In walked three of the tall , graceful beings , respirators humming quietly , large knowing eyes surveying the simmering crowd . The troublesome . The rebellious . The *instigators* . * ” …you can convince them of the truth . It is every Human ’ s duty to help lift their species to the next… ” * The three aliens stood in the doorway , flanked by several heavily-armed and grim-faced human militia . The tension ran thick , and only the drolling prerecorded surrender speech broke the silence . * ” …together we will stomp out this petty rebellion , and your species will know paradise . And , to the instigators I say this ; you have a choice to make . Will you join your fellow Humans in enlightenment among the stars ? Or will you carry on this pathetic struggle , to fight and die in vain ? ” * A glass flew from the back of the bar , seemed to hang in the air , and with a sickening crack it took the lead alien in the face . It was time . *** *If you liked what you read , be sure to check out my [ subreddit ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/Irishpersonage/comments/4i1vq9/welcome/ ) for more of my prompt responses . *	0.9999957084655762
At first , Jonathan was happy to witness the end of the world . You see , when billions of humans dropped dead due to some sort of rootkit virus , Jonathan was vindicated . All of the high school bullies who called him `` penguin head '' and beat him up using their proprietary additions were gone . `` But your operating system has major security vulnerabilities ! '' He would stammer as they chanted `` Linux loser ! Linux Loser ! '' day after day . But they did not listen , the ease of updating their drivers and accessing their steam games was worth the risk to them , he assumed . But now , 2 years after Windows 16 ushered 6 billion people to early graves , he was wishing they 'd return . The hustle and bustle of city streets full of workers , businessmen , and taxis has disappeared , with starbucks filled with apple hipsters now on every corner . With every apple user hurriedly `` writing their next big novel '' and mixing music , Linux users had the world to themselves . Which of course , resulted in each one promptly returning to their parent 's basements and starving to death , waiting for the mountain dew and doritos that their dead mothers never brought down .	0.9999959468841553
Three days eleven hours five minutes twenty one seconds . How long could it possibly take ? My body lies motionless on a morgue slab . I 'm trapped inside ... but is that the right way to say it ? ... yes it most deffinately is . I see others like me walking the halls . They are peaceful for the most part . Except that bastard Jimmy . He keeps moving some poor man 's wireless mouse from place to place . I really do pitty the man . I see these spirits with almost as much freedom as an alive person , yet I 'm still stuck to my body . There is something different about my situation . The other spirits seem to need to stay close to their bodies , but they also can walk , talk , and interact with the invironment ... to a certain extent . Is this part of my punishment ? Have I committed some sin that leaves me entombed in my body for eternity ? I 've now been here for almost five days . A body normally does n't even stay at the morgue this long . I 've noticed the mortician studying me rather close . He seems to be taking measurements of some kind . Taking tissue samples . Running tests . Is my cause of death a mystery ? They have to know what happened . I was in the hospital for several days before I died . That ca n't be what he 's doing . What did he just say ? The mortician . I 've been able to understand him till now . Sound ... it 's becoming muffled . My sight is blurring . Thought it 's self is becoming more difficult ... I seem to be losing cognitive functions . What did I do in life ? What was my job ? ... . lab tech . I ran tests . Did I have a wife ? ... no-wait-yes ! Her name was Jenny . What is my name ? ... . Movement . In my right hand ... . I ... felt it .	0.9999960660934448
So these two punks . Jonce and Fuckin ' Nielbert . I heard about them a month ago . They stumbled on something . They were in the meat district when they see someone passing out fliers to an Easter egg hunt in October . They thought they 'd gone mad ! They solicitor was incessant that they take the flier , but 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 That 's all that was on the flier . A bunch of ones ! Seriously , what ? Here 's the thing , the solicitor was so insisting and happy to be giving the flier , that they could n't put it down . Jonce and Fuckbert held onto that flier for the rest of the day and looked at it wondering what it meant . That was about 1 year ago . Now Jonce and Bertbert are millionaires and philanthropists . Could n't tell you what they do though . Was too complicated for me . But every once in a while , I draw all them ones and ask myself what it all means .	0.9999444484710693
`` I looked at that ThirdGenMem site the other day , with David . '' Maggie looked despondent , empty even , as she pulled out a chair after sharing their ritual Tuesday greetings at the start of their ritual Tuesday lunch . Sal had n't even enquired as to her life-long friends apparent unhappiness yet . Looked like she did n't need to either as Maggie continued . `` It was ... interesting , at least . Nice , I suppose ? '' `` Oh ? '' probed Sal . Since the release of the instantly famous website , many technological advancements had been forthcoming . A couple of months ago some smart computery-type-person had figured out a way to send what are effectively emails back in time . Most people did n't get too much sent back of course , because , quite frankly , most people are boring . All the celebrities got some traffic ( though significantly less than you 'd think ) but it was the scientists who got the most sent back . New data on equations and other sciency stuff . It was limited to a short window of a rather convenient 100 years into the future , give or take . One of the first things to come through was a request to open a website up to the public to allow them to receive information from the future , from family or close friends if they happen to have survived so long , which supposedly was fairly common . Sal had n't bothered with it , though it was increasingly difficult to explain the *why* behind that decision . She knew that she 'd eventually succumb to temptation and register . `` Yeah , I read a message . From a girl called 'Julia ' . '' Maggie began to fidget , a smile on her lips but sadness in her eyes . `` Julia ? That 's a nice name . Was she a granddaughter or something ? '' `` Great granddaughter , actually . She has n't been born yet , but she 's Davids . '' A genuine smile alighted upon Maggies face , eyes and all . David , one of Maggies two sons , had n't had much luck with women . `` She sent a small hello , and attached her diary from when she was a child . She said she wanted to give us a taste of what it was like , or , what it will be like , growing up in the future . It was n't very long , I do n't think she much enjoyed keeping a diary . Only covered about four years or so . '' The waiter arrived and confirmed , rather than took , their order . A luxury of the Regular Visitor . Sal pressed on with a question . `` So , why the frown ? '' `` Hm ? Oh . Well . So I read the diary , most of it anyway . But , it 's strange to think about how much you 've done in life , y'know ? How many stories you have to tell , all the crazy things you 've seen throughout the years . I used to wonder how my children and their children would remember me . What stories they would tell , what kind of an impact I 'd have on their lives , even though I was n't around any more . '' Maggies eyes dropped to her hands as she fidgeted with her purse , reluctant to go on . Sal sat , opting for nagging silence , until Maggie continued . `` She does n't mention me , you know . She does n't even know me . Everything I 've done , and I end up forgotten . '' Sal reached across the table to hold Maggies hands reassuringly . `` They do remember you , Mags . She does remember you . She sent the message , after all . '' A tear was hanging onto Maggies eyelash as she looked up . `` No . I have n't been sent anything . I read it on Davids account . My inbox is still empty . '' The waiter delivered the two tea 's and plate of scones to table number 4 , then went to greet the woman and child who walked through the door .	0.9999960660934448
Taylor rushed past the hordes of reporters that lined the pathways of the spacious university campus . She dashed in and out between the teams of reporters preparing to go live in a matter of minutes , without causing a second glance in her direction . It felt like a lifetime since the news had been made public , when in reality , the leak had gone live two hours ago . No one quite knew of what to make of the news . How could anyone react to realization that we had never been the only ones in the universe ? To make matters even more puzzling , the fish like sentient creature had been discovered right in our solar system- right on Jupiter ’ s own Europa . Before Taylor even had time to make any sense of the news , she had received a call from her boss to rush directly to the “ stage ” as he liked to call his prep room for the presidential debates . When Taylor finally pushed her way to the locked classroom door , she knocked twice and entered the dark room to find her boss hunched over a nightlight and a humidifier . “ Taylor have you heard ? ” He asked without looking up from the light . She nodded . “ I have . Now what ? ” The year was 2020 and the presidential election was being hyped up more than ever before . Nobody in a thousand years could have ever predicted the outcome of the 2016 election . With only ten days to go before the general election , Hillary Clinton , after being fed up with Trump ’ s sexist remarks , challenged Trump to a bake-off . If Trump could bake a better devil ’ s food cake , then she would renounce her bid for the presidency . Much to everyone ’ s surprise , the guy could bake some of the best cake anyone could ever have . However , to no one ’ s surprise , when Donald Trump entered the presidency , he shrugged off his idea to build a giant wall and focused his attention of expanding the space program . Drawing money from his own personal fortune , Donald Trump turned the United States space program into the best in the world . When asked why he cared so much about space exploration , typical Trump would respond that he wanted to have another option in case those damn Muslim terrorist blew up the Earth . Everyone had always assumed that Trump would run for reelection , but he insisted that he didn ’ t intend to stay in office for more than four years . Now , if people thought that Trump running for president was crazy that was nothing to what the 2020 presidential candidates were . Sure some were extremely well qualified , but others , let ’ s just say no one ever considered would be running . Among those was rapper Kanye West , who ran with the Democrat party . Somehow , he rose to the top of the polls , and before anyone could say are we really doing this again , another entertainer became a contender for the white house . Nobody for the life of them could figure out how they got Kanye West vs Sarah Palin 2020 . Taylor snapped the compact mirror shut and tossed it into her tote before looking at the man sitting across from her on the private jet as they flew straight towards the Hollywood Hills . He was dressed in an immaculate black tux , a new look for him . She stayed quiet as she waited for the man to speak . After all , he had called her and she wasn ’ t one to speak unless spoken to . After a brief moment of silence , the rapper cleared his throat and tapped his hand on the table . “ Taylor , I understand that we haven ’ t been on speaking terms of as lately , but I need your help. ” Taylor stayed silent and feigned disinterest as she turned her head to look at the dozens of aquariums scattered throughout the plane . “ As you ’ ve probably heard , I ’ m running for president in 2020 and I ’ ve got a serious problem . I ’ ve done a fair bit of polls and research on my end and it appears I might have this election in the bag . I need you to make sure it stays that way. ” Taylor laughs and shakes her head . “ What do you need me for . You can hire the very best campaign manager money can buy . I don ’ t have any political experience and quite frankly I could care less about this type of stuff. ” “ That ’ s true , but you are the very best at keeping people ’ s attention . I want you to make sure that the public continues to pay attention as I lay low for a while . And perhaps maybe even stir up some dirt on Palin while you ’ re at it . I can assure you that you will be very justly rewarded for this. ” Kanye folds his fingers on top of each other and stares in Taylor ’ s direction . “ Why would you stay low at a time like this. ” “ Let ’ s just say Mr. Trump is onto something huge that I have a personal stake in . Now , do we have a deal or not ? ” Taylor laughs and begins to stand up from her seat before Kanye grabs her hand and holds her in place . “ I can help make them pay . All of those guys who left you without a second glance in your direction won ’ t have the last word . After all , everyone assumes that Guantanamo shut down , and who ’ s to say that is or is not true . Paper work gets lost all the time and sometimes try as we might stuff happens by accident. ” Kanye smiles at the last bit . Taylor looks over at Kanye and sits back down . Perhaps she could listen , if only for just a second . “ Taylor , I need you to get the word out. ” Kanye half whispers . Taylor frowns in confusion . “ This is weird , I ’ m going to turn the lights on , ” she says . Before Kanye can stop her , Taylor flips the light switch on . She stifles a scream as she realizes that she is surrounded by hundreds if not thousands of fish bowls with fish floating in them . Right in front of her , Kanye is dressed in an aqua metallic wet suit . “ What ’ s going on ? ” She manages to get out . Kanye smiles and outstretches his hands . “ Don ’ t you understand Swift ; this recent discovery has helped me come to terms with who I am . It ’ s time that everyone knew . After this , I ’ m going to renounce my bid for presidency and give my support for you. ” Taylor ’ s heart picks up in excitement . “ Okay then , what should I tell the awaiting public ? ” She asks . “ Tell them that I , Kanye West , am a gay fish. ”	0.9999419450759888
When Sergeant Mathers shouted through the headset aboard the plane before the jump , the words he spoke cut me like a hot knife through butter . `` Within 2 hours you will either kill or be killed . When you hit the ground , they will be shooting at you . Shoot them first . '' My parents did n't amount to much , but they were fantastic parents . I am their only child so when I got drafted , their initial response was to pack my bags and send me off to my cousin in South Africa . Before the war I had n't been hit by the patriotism bug that many had , but when I saw a picture of the Prom King that I went to school with head 's cut in two by the blade of a downed MiG , I knew I could not pass off the call when it came . As I stood at the now open door of the plane , it was this memory that took my mind off Mather 's comment long enough to forget about vomiting . I glanced down at the grey Stars and Stripes patch on my uniform and leapt from the plane . The first few moments after the jump were a blur . Even now I do n't remember any of it . I 'd zoned out until a crack snapped past my head . The fuckers were firing anti-aircraft rounds at us . Cheap shot . At least it was pitch black , but they got damn close considering they were firing blind . `` Contact '' shouted Mathers . It was way too late to change course and I pulled my chute . The sound of a parachute opening is always a relief . At least when you are n't being shot at from the ground . I could hear the chutes of my comrades launch . The radio crackled . `` Is everyone OK ? '' Mathers asked in an unusually nervous tone . I do n't think even he had experienced anything like that before . We took the term sitting ducks to a new level that night . `` Jones , Graham , Thompson , Baker ... '' . The register was entirely met with ayes . The firing from the ground stopped . We landed 2 clicks East of our intended destination but after looking at the team , I do n't think any of them cared . They looked drawn out . Zombie-like almost . I had never felt more alive . My heart was pumping but it felt good . It was euphoric . Tough-nut Mathers had already composed himself and pinpointed on his map where we had to go . The Spanish air smelled sweet . We were set to rendezvous in the rebel held City of Valencia . The Russian/German alliance had been decimated by a series of allied nuclear attacks in France , Poland and and Southern Russia . The UK Prime Minister ordered the attacks after intelligence advised of a planned German invasion from France . History always seems to repeat itself . 17 million had died as a result of the allied bombs . When it happened I could n't believe it , but not I felt as though I could take the rebels on by hand . I was ready to fight . I was ready to die . I did n't enjoy school , and from what I 've already said you can gather that I was n't Prom King . Not even close in fact . I was quite literally last in line to the throne . Probably behind a few of the girls too , I might add . I 'm not particularly hideous and certainly not overweight but in the social jungle of High School I chose to keep myself to myself . I 'm not sure why I was thinking about school as we trecked silently through nighttime Spain . The occasional gun shot could be heard but the Spanish rebels were hardly the most reserved characters . We were on the edge of the city when we came across a Humvee by the side of the road . It was strange purely because there were n't supposed to be any Allied forces in this area yet . As we got closer to it we found a puddle of blood behind the wheel . I brought my gun up ready to fire . I was damn ready to kill someone . I peered into the vehicle to find a headless Marine . I should have been disgusted but I was n't . I was excited . I overheard Jones muttering away while I was in the Humvee searching for anything useful . `` CONTACT RIGHT '' `` CONTACT LEFT '' What the fuck . All at once . This was it . The moment . I scrambled to get out of the Humvee , slipped in the excitement and slammed my head into the door frame thing . As I came to I saw Jones get shot in the head . Splat . That was him done . My excitement turned to dismay . CHRIST . Where had his face gone . Were they shooting bricks ? Damn . There was nothing left from the shoulders up . I was lucky to be covered by the vehicle . I duck down and collect my thoughts . The feeling of being alive was back . Stronger this time . I did n't want to lose it . I soon realised why Jones had no head left when anti-aircraft rounds slammed into the Humvee . Poor Jones had taken a round to the head . He died like Obama in Kingsman . Losing his head in a puff of smoke . I looked across at Mathers who had found his way into a ditch . They 'd taken out th attackers on the right while I was out cold . He pointed at the Humvee I was hiding behind . He wanted me to get on the mounted 50 cal . Okay . I climbed into the Humvee and peered out a hole in the back . The shooting stopped . Something had jammed in their gun in the back of a pick up truck . This was my moment . I jumped up , readied the weapon and fired . They noticed and tried to run but it was too late . My bullets cut them down . 10s of lives ended just like that . One of them only looked like a kid . 15 maybe , but I did n't care . `` Good job , Private . '' Barked Mathers . I went over to him . He patted me on the back and I threw up . `` That 's war for you . '' He was right . That was war . And I fucking loved it .	0.9999922513961792
I stand in a grand hall filled with chairs facing weapons of old , strangely they are clean and shiny they almost look new . A strange man in a robe approaches `` Hello ... my name is Francis , I am to guide you to your weapon '' `` Hello '' I mutter back , `` how will I know which one is mine ? '' `` It will tell you '' We start out walk down the endless hall . It was only weeks ago I was approached by strange people telling me I have been selected to fight in an epic battle . And I guess this is where my journey starts ... Me and Francis continue walking down the hall.. when a chair a strange chair appears to be different to the others . I walk to the chair and sit down . `` And now it begins '' Francis whispers As I sit metal straps bind me to the chair I start to feel a painful cut under my wrist.. the pain intensifies as a blade quickly removes my hand . The chair releases me I scream in pain . I look up at my new weapons . Francis voice becomes deep and croaky `` I 'm gon na rip you 're head off and fuck you up the ass ! ! '' I attach my custom chainsaw and grab my boomstick . `` Groovy . '' Edit : Spelling	0.9999948740005493
Warm rays of sunlight peek through the crack between the curtains and touch softly on my skin . She tells me they make no sound , and I 'm glad . With the curtains closed our worlds become almost the same . At any rate , the light is just as warm to me as it is to her . If I close my eyes , we can be one . I can see the keys before me , can see the soft twisting of light they reflect as I play them , but they are silent to me . I only know the music they make is beautiful because she tells me so . My world is bright and colourful , but it is quiet . She is the only one who speaks to me . Not just with the flourishes of her hands as she signs to me how pretty the new tune I 've written is , but also in the soft touch of her fingers on my skin , her light breath on my face , and the worlds she creates on canvas . She tells me I am beautiful in a way I can never know . And somehow it means more when she says it . She 's not the only one who does ; so many others have called me a genius , an inspiration . A deaf pianist , what a miracle ! I do n't think it 's a miracle . If it was , I would n't know . I see the keys , I play them , they say it makes them feel something beautiful but it means nothing to me . All I know is what she tells me . And I struggle to speak back because speaking is hard for me , and I do n't know what she hears when I do . What I say is probably different from what I mean , and I ca n't know if it is or not . I find I can not sign happiness or sadness or love and give it the same meaning it has in my heart . And when I compose , I ca n't understand my own songs . The only way I can really speak to others is when I write . But my words are silent , and they can not speak to her . And yet I still speak to her better than anyone else , without knowing how . All I know is that she hears me , and she loves what she hears . Maybe it 's the same as why I love her . She touches me in a way that she can not understand . She creates beautiful worlds that I try to describe to her , but my words are never enough . She 'll never know what her creations make me feel , but maybe that is what makes them so wonderful . It 's hard to hold back tears when I stop to think about it . She is my inspiration . She lets me know what I make her feel by making me feel the same way . She is a miracle , and the words 'blind painter ' do n't even begin to describe why . She lights this word with a light she can not see , gives it a meaning she can not understand , she exists to create a paradise open to everyone but herself . And so I finally understand . This is what I am to her , this is what I make her feel . We may not be able to know the beauty in ourselves , but we can know the beauty of each other . She is the meaning in my life , and I am the meaning in hers . I do n't know how , but I can feel these words rush through me and into the notes I am playing . She places a hand on my arm , and I know that I feel as warm to her as she feels to me . I smile at her and see that she 's singing . I can not hear her , but somehow I know that it sounds beautiful .	0.0015066497726365924
Apologies in advance , this is my first prompt and I 'm writing it on my phone because I 'm bored on the train . -- -- -- -- It 's been 5 years since the first Fire Fight appeared , although lets be honest that was less of a fight and more of a massacre . The second great fire of London spread through the city despite the best efforts of the local old style fire fighters . They tried everything on the flames , water , foam , gas but no matter what seconds later the flames would flicker back into life and continue their spread . After a few days of futile attempts to save the city the Prime Minister announced the abandonment of London . People ran , leaving their entire lives behind to the hungry flames which where only stopped by massive ditches dug around the boundaries of the city , the Fire rages still , never ceasing . It 's much too big and old even for the best of us . Still , some good came from this . The never ending fire was contained which allowed scientists to study it through tests at the boundaries and flyovers to explore the centre . We discovered that the fires had a ... a heart , beating in the centre like a giant ember , it was obvious that it needed to be tackled to stop the Fire , but again nothing worked on it , aerial drops of water and foam burst into steam on contact amid a deafening roar . However one useful discovery was that sea water worked to a certain degree , rather than coming back to life instantly the fire was quenched for a minute or two , but alas the ember would continue to beat and eventually fan the flames back to life . The real breakthrough happened when a Fire started in a little coastal town , lacking access to large amount of water apart from the sea , one local firefighter used an old style pump to douse the flames with sea water after which he found the ember . He drenched the ember similarly and was shocked and horrified when it let out a scream of rage and unfolded into a monstrous humanoid shape before loping forward and punching a burning hole through him , this we know because his neighbour was following him with his phone camera turned on , he managed to escape , lucky for him ... or not perhaps , he now lives a solitary life in an asylum . From there on it became clear what we needed . We did n't need firefighters , we needed Fire Fighters , hardened individuals trained in hand to hand combat that could fight their way to the Ember with sea water , douse it and then defeat it to put out the fire ... and now here I stand , at the doors of the Fire Fighting academy to enrol myself , for I have nothing to lose any longer and a rage burns in me , for my entire family were in London ...	0.9999024868011475
It happened January 1st , 2018 . They called it the Rapture , but I knew better . Across our world walls started to fall from the skies . They were caging us in like little rats . Who were they ? We do n't know . But it is evident that some being is doing this to us , to test us , to enslave us . The final wall came but not from the sides , it covered the sky . Our sky . Our beautiful light had been extinguished . It feels like it has been years , but today finally we got our first sign of hope . The walls shifted . They shifted . It was the slightest of movement , but all across the land we started to cheer . We were almost free . As they shifted again , we began to hear a voice . `` M ... ooo ... '' We stopped and raised our ears as we listened intently . LIGHT It blazed in from the sky as we saw the upper wall come crashing down . It fell on hundreds of us , smashing us immediately . Screams began to ring out , as we scrambled to survive . As the last part of the wall collapsed , we saw a shadow descend upon our land . It 's spoke . `` Mom ! ! ! I got new legos ! ! !

The pencil was sharp , but not sharp enough . Dave knew it had to perfect and no less , the overlords demanded it . Dave wished for the days before the coup occoured , when a dull pencil did n't mean death , but things had happened how they happened and the Perfectionist party was now in power . He tested the tip on his finger again , it broke . Too thin . Dave looked over to the administrator and breathed a sigh of relief ; the administrator was busy imprinting a mark on one of his classmate 's arms . The two marks on Dave 's arm were still in the process of going away . Dave would need another week before they disappeared and the threat of a third would go with them . He continued to sharpen the pencil . After turning the sharpener a few times the pencil came out as perfect as can be . Satisfied , Dave returned to his desk and continued to write his essay . He tried to ignore his classmate being walked out of the room by the administrator . `` Only perfection survives '' , Dave thought , a phrase he was forced to repeat every morning , a phrase he had only just started believing .	0.9999797344207764
They keep telling me my name is “ Kel ” , but I don ’ t know who to believe . Really , the only thing I know is that this room is cold , everything is white , and that a draft keeps creeping between this dress-like thing I have on . Apparently that woman is my wife , but she isn ’ t really my type , I think . I mean , she *is* pretty , but after looking at myself in the mirror , I ’ m positive I could do much better than her . But what I do believe is that the older lady is my mom since we have the same eyes and dimples . Besides these two people , and the man wearing a white coat that just walked in the door , I have no idea what is going . “ Kel , you have a suffered a traumatic brain injury and these people are here for you ” , the man said . I was confused , they didn ’ t know me…and I especially didn ’ t know them . Honestly , I didn ’ t know anything . But if I had to go with a story , then , here it goes : My name is Kel . I woke up this morning , was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury , had some pudding , and met some new people .	0.9999769926071167
It was a particularly frigid winter afternoon . I was just leaving the train station and started walking in the direction of home when I noticed a homeless man huddled under a streetlamp near the taxi rank . He only had a thin shirt on , tattered black jeans and no shoes or jacket . The poor man was going to freeze in this weather . As I approached him I dug my hand into my pocket to search for some spare change . I did n't have any coins , but I did have an unopened chocolate piece that was still in its foil and had n't melted yet . As Aesop once said , no act of kindness , no matter how small , is ever wasted . So I took the small piece of chocolate and dropped it into the man 's felt hat that was sitting on the sidewalk in front of his legs . `` What the fuck is this ! ? '' he howled . He turned the hat over so that the chocolate fell into his open palm . `` What the FUCK is this ? I want money goddamit ! '' He spat on my shoes and I ran off . Yeah , fuck you Aesop .	0.00015076278941705823
My name is Robert Van Witt . Everyone calls me Robbie but I wish they ’ d call me Rob . I don ’ t correct them anymore because when I would , it ’ s like they didn ’ t hear . I ’ m trudging up a hill to my buddy Tyler ’ s birthday party . I don ’ t really want to go . He ’ s turning 16 , same age as me . I ’ d be pedaling this incline but my bike is out of commission . It ’ s not a long story . Basically I ’ m a target . I don ’ t fight back . The insecure pick on me ; the secure could care less . So it ’ s like victimless . Last Wednesday Brandon snatched my bike from my hands , hefted it way up , bellowed , “ This is Sparta ! ” and heaved it into the wall . Now the front rim ’ s all bent . What gets me though is people laughed at a botched reference . But if I ’ d biked I ’ d get sweaty and when I sweat I stink . Any deodorant I use starts to smell like me , or I start to smell like it , or something ’ s off . Either way it all reeks . It ’ s bad enough when my shirt soaks through and makes me wince when I sit back against a chair but I can live with that . It ’ s when I sweat and I start to smell really bad , or worse yet when I suspect that I may but I just can ’ t tell . I ’ m convinced every time a girl puts on lotion it ’ s to cover my odor . I ’ ve got this sick habit , a compulsion really , where I feel that I reek all the f ’ in time . Well when I ’ m around people . I think it ’ s me focusing my anxiety on something physical , explainable . So I ’ m always retreating to the toilet , which reeks , to check my pits , which reek , to reapply speed stick , which reeks less . You don ’ t want to know how many bars I go through . I order them in bulk , let ’ s leave it at that . The thing about the socially anxious , is that we are not wholly convinced of our inferiority . Well , that I assume , as I make it a point to avoid those who remind me of myself . But I believe we are not wholly convinced of our inferiority . We recognize it at times , strongly at times . But there is a certain awareness , an innate intelligence necessary to recognize this . The dull do not know they are incompetent . Let me clear this up . I hate myself . I believe I am a god . I loathe and love myself ; the love is more distant . I am at once fearful and prideful . Ashamed and arrogant . These beliefs are separate but linked , like joined rings . I make it to Tyler ’ s at the top of the hill . The Ryan ’ s and Will are headed this way but about a block off . I don ’ t think they see me but I avert my gaze anyway . The clouds in the sky are rows of cotton . Sometimes I feel like a slave . I don ’ t knock I just walk right in . I ’ m family here Tyler ’ s mom says but I don ’ t feel it . Or maybe like the one guy who doesn ’ t speak at the reunions . There ’ s nobody here . All in the backyard , something dissonant is trailing through the screen door , that means Abdur is here , the self-appointed dj at all gatherings . I hate entrances . I make for the bathroom . “ Robbie ! ” it ’ s Kim , she ’ s inches from my face . I jump . “ You ’ re so oblivious ! ” she ’ s smiling with both rows of chompers . This kind of offends me . I ’ m highly observant it ’ s just I get overwhelmed . “ Sorry , ” I offer . “ Don ’ t get mad , maybe just look where you ’ re going. ” it creeps me out when she smiles like this . She doesn ’ t have dead eyes or a weird twitch or anything , it ’ s just so much face to take in . “ I ’ m so happy you ’ re finally here. ” yeah , well I ’ m not . “ Here I want to show you something , ” She grabs my hand . This girl is always trying to jump my bones and she isn ’ t shy about it . “ Actually I got ta take a leak. ” “ No you don ’ t . And you smell fine. ” “ Uh , ” “ C ’ mon , ” she drags me into Tyler ’ s bedroom and pushes me onto the bed , closing the door behind us . “ Check this out , ” she ’ s showing me a photo on her phone , it ’ s real out-of- focus . “ Oh , neat. ” “ Yeah I just got her this morning. ” “ I didn ’ t know you liked rats. ” “ She ’ s a Pomeranian ! ” “ Oh , yeah , I can see that. ” She ’ s giving me this sidelong stare . Eye contact I struggle with . I can ’ t remember how long it ’ s been this way . “ So…IshouldgofindTyler. ” at least I didn ’ t stutter , “ Ok seeya ! ” She clasps my shoulder , firmly . She ’ s a rock climber . She ’ s still giving me this stare . I think she thinks it ’ s sexy , smoky . She leans in close . I feel like I ’ m in traction . She ’ s whispering in my ear , hot and wet . I ’ m having a lot of trouble focusing on what she ’ s saying . I know I ’ m getting red . All I can think is I pray that no one walks in . “ Hey you know what ? It ’ s the damndest thing , ” yes I talk like this . “ I just remembered my Grandma ’ s in the hospital , yeah bad UTI , and I promised my mom I ’ d call her and she takes her afternoon nap at three and would you look at the time ! ” I sort of duck and twist under her arm to extricate myself . “ No she isn ’ t . Why are you so nervous ? ” Because last time you squeezed my sack so hard I almost cried . “ Nervous ? Me ? ” “ Fine , ” she ’ s got her arms crossed looking stony-eyed , like through me , “ And you don ’ t even want to go to the movies tomorrow…remind me again why we ’ re even a thing ? ” “ What ? Yes I do ! I ’ ll text you. ” I skedaddle out of there and beeline for the toilet . When I make it outside I see , thank God , we ’ re not all sitting around the table . It ’ s a clean crowd for the most part and they ’ re sugar buzzed . Will and Sarah are jumping on the tramp and the Ryan ’ s , Jim , Kari , Kevin , and Megan are playing basketball . Tyler and Abdur are sitting in plastic lawn chairs by the stereo passing a vaporizer . “ Robbie ! ” “ Why hello there gents , ” “ Pull up a seat , catch up , ” Abdur goes to pass me the MLFB . “ No thanks , ” I can only partake in private , or social interaction goes from nerve wracking to excruciating . “ Suit yourself , ” Abdur ’ s wearing shades , the Visine only goes so far . “ You seen Kim ? ” Tyler asks , “ She said she was coming. ” “ Uh , no. ” The sun ’ s in my eyes . “ She ambushed you inside ? ” Tyler ’ s smiling . “ You need to just be straight with her man , ” Abdur is gon na make for a great life-coach someday . “ I know… ” “ Your problem is you try so hard to please everyone , you don ’ t think about yourself . And when you do that , you ’ re cheating them . Well I mean not Kim , she feeds on that but- ” “ Tell me about it. ” “ Look buddy , I know exactly how you feel , ” Abdur raises his shades and wants to have like a man to man moment . Goddamnit . “ You feel like you have to make people happy , comfortable . Well you can ’ t man . You literally can not worry about that . When you try so hard you ’ re doing the opposite – you ’ re putting people on edge . They can tell . We can tell , ” He waggles a hitchhiker ’ s thumb between himself and Tyler , “ I used to be like you man , so worried all the time about what people think . But here ’ s the thing – you can ’ t do an effin thing about it . People want the real you man , not like this persona you try so hard to portray . I know because that was me . And believe me , when you ’ re brown in a town like this people stare . But you just got ta straighten up , brush it off , tell yourself you have the same right as anyone else to be here . Look , I had it bad and I got over that sh*t. If I could there ’ s no reason you can ’ t. ” “ …I know , ” my head ’ s declined , I ’ m shaking it in solemn agreement . “ No you don ’ t ! See this is exactly what I ’ m talking about . You ’ re agreeing with me but you aren ’ t really . Tell me to f**k off ! Don ’ t be a people pleaser ! ” “ Hey you got any SpaceApe on there ? ” thank you Tyler . “ Kode9 , hell yeah ! ” The sun ’ s frying me like an egg on blacktop . “ I got ta take a pisser , ” “ Sure , ” The party ’ s really winding down now . They were splitting cake around the table when I was headed back out earlier and I pretended like I forgot my present for Tyler at home . I walked a couple blocks down the hill to the park and sat myself on a bench and smoked a Marb light and hated myself for it . It ’ s pathetic and I know it . “ Tyler , this is for you. ” “ Thanks buddy ! Okay , let me guess , ” he shakes the package with a wry grin . “ Blue Velvet. ” “ How… ” “ You must ’ ve hinted at it last week or something . Hey Rob , I ’ m glad you could make it . Really , it means a lot. ” “ Of course my dude ! Just can ’ t believe I forgot your present at home . Missed the cake , ” “ Yeah . So we still doubling tomorrow ? ” On the way back , kicking myself in penitence , I sigh and look skyward . The clouds are gossamer now , like gauze I think .	0.9999916553497314
`` Sup brah '' Frankie said while drinking my soda right in front of me . `` Cmon man you cant at least use a cup ! '' I exclaim in a clearly pissed off tone . `` Hah good ond broski , well I got ta go rush for kapla delta gamma , peace dork ! '' He was your typical frat guy who got paired up with me , the loser . Day in and day out its as if he knows my every pet peeve , but what could I possibly do ? `` Alex , Alex , Alex '' the wind seemed to whisper , `` ALEX ALEX ALEX '' it grew louder , `` Who are you ! ? '' I frighteningly whimpered . `` I have had many names over the course of history , Krampus , boogeyman , Grendel but you can refer to me as Savior . '' His every word dragged out like a snake , Ive heard those names before , but theyre simply legends and myths and surely they cant all be the same person ? Nonetheless I was curious as to what would come next . `` Ok Savior tell me what are you saving me from ? '' I snark back trying to not show fear . `` We both know what Im here to save you from ... Frankie , hes a scourge of this hall with no respect or boundaries , Ive been watching and I know how much you hate him . '' He whispered back , I tried to see him but his voice seemed to be coming from all directions . `` Yea Frankies a real piece of shit alright but I already tried getting a new roommate and they denied my request ! '' I reply . `` You see child I can make him disappear forever , the days of his arrogance are over ! '' He exclaimed . `` Whoa , whoa , whoa I hate him and all but I cant let you just kill him ! '' I proclaim defending my morality . `` Oh you silly child , Im not going to kill him Im just taking him to a better place ! '' He seemingly innocently explained . `` In that case Im all for it ! '' I exclaim joyously happy to find my solution to Frankie . `` Gooooood hehehehe by tomorrow morning he shall be gone . '' *The next morning* `` Shit I have the worst hangover '' I was soaked in something warm . Did I piss myself ? I open my eyes and see Im in Frankies bed but wheres Frankie ? I roll over and there he is . The warm liquid I felt was his blood and it was everywhere , a large knife was sticking out his neck . `` Oh no no no what have I done shit ok uhhhhh shit everyones going to think I did this ! Did I do this ? WHY CANT I REMEMBER ! '' I scream . `` I have no choice but to turn myself in ... '' *One year later* `` Today marks the one year anniversary of the most brutal murder this city has ever seen . Alex Hannigan currently in a maximum security psych ward was charged with murdering his roommate Frankie DeMarco and deemed insane after his numerous claims that some creature called `` Savior '' made him do it '' The newscaster explained . `` Man fuck this Im not crazy he was real ! im not some schizo ! '' I proclaim to my cell mate Jax . `` Sure thing bro we all say that in here ! '' He laughed at first I liked jax but ive slowly grown annoyed of him . Night time comes around the orderlies bring me my meds . `` Maybe i am crazy maybe i am schizophrenic , '' I think to myself as I swallow the 5 different pills Im on . I lay in bed ready to crash and fall asleep . Until it happened ... again ... `` Alex alex alex '' I heard . `` This cant be real Im imagining things do these meds even work ! ? '' I think to myself . `` ALEX ALEX ALEX ! ! ! '' Looks like theres no going back now.. shit .	0.9999960660934448
`` Hide those cables '' , I started to get stressed . We were about to take off and Jane 's cables were in plain sight . `` They 're going to notice it '' . Jane and I started working out our plan a few months ago . We invited two companions to hijack this plane with us : Eric and Jerome . It was n't until a few months later that Eric and Jerome went their own way . They did n't value our motives , yet knew we had to do it . `` Here she goes '' , Jane said . We felt the plane driving faster . `` This is our moment , Kane , this is the moment we can make a difference '' . Our motives were simple : we had to hijack this plane to improve air security . We were fed up with all these terrorist attacks and hijacks . We had to prove it was n't going well , had to show the leaks . Even if it killed us . I got pushed back into my chair as we took off . My heart was beating faster than it ever had before . This was the day I was going to make the difference I had always wanted in life . From birth my goals was to become unforgettable . To be read about in history books . To be seen as the hero that saved countless lives . And this was the best way to do it . I had never seen Jane this happy . It was almost evil . We worked out our plan : we get up during the flight , start yelling we are hijacking the plane , make the pilot land and start communicating with the authorities afterwards . It was a solid plan . It took months of preparation . It even involved hiring a hitman to kill Eric and Jerome . If you ca n't do it one way , you got ta do it the other way . I heard some rumbling behind me . It did n't really occur to me that much that there were about 200 other people on this flight . The people right behind me seemed nervous . But I flew before , I know people get nervous . I hear the seat belt light going out . It was almost time . We said we 'd do it 20 minutes after the light would go out . Time for a good drink first . I eased my mind a bit and saw the steward coming our way . `` Good morning , sir . What can I get you ? `` , he asked , with a slight bitter undertone . I asked him how he was doing . Just like any kind steward he said he was alright . Yet the undertone in his voice made me feel otherwise . I asked him again , pointing out that he sounded a bit bitter . `` It 's just the usual , he said . We 're an hour late due to hijack threats '' . I started laughing internally . He will be in for a surprise . `` I see , well , was the danger cleared ? `` , I asked . `` Yes , yes sir , there is no threat right now '' . It seemed like an ironic answer , cause I knew it 'd be otherwise . `` EVERYBODY HANDS UP ! `` , I heard from the back of the plane . I freaked out . How could this happen ? Do the authorities know about us ? I did n't dare look back to see who it was . `` Put your hands up or we will blow up the plane '' , I heard a second voice say . The letters W , T and F were all that was left in my mind right now . A second hijack ? We had n't even done ours yet . We were still 10 minutes away . `` No , you put your hands up '' . The steward got up and opened his shirt . Jane freaked out . I freaked out . The steward was wearing a bomb vest and holding a wired button in his left hand . I could n't handle it for a second , this was not where I thought my day was headed . Danger by the time we landed , sure . But danger up in the air ? Our plan was ruined . I could n't take it anymore , I got up . `` You ! `` , I yelled at the steward . `` Come over here ! '' . The steward looked confused and started laughing . `` I said , come over here ! '' The other passengers were looking at me like I was crazy . Maybe I was , all I knew is that I had to make the best out of our own situation , I still wanted credits for this hijack and I was n't going down in history on a passengers death list . Jane was looking at me . I nodded at her . She knew this was the signal . Jane got up and took of her shirt . Now , I know we had a lot more preparation than the steward , but Jane 's vest was really , really advanced . You have to imagine a teletubby-like bomb vest including a timer , a screen and a camera . We were going to film the entire hijack . I guess all we 're filming now is a terrorist stand-off . The other passengers started yelling . There was some Chinese , some Arabic , but mainly just of pile of 'shits ' and 'fucks ' flying around from every corner in the plane . A team of 5 people got up , pulling guns and threatening to kill every one of us . This was just met with lots of laughter from the other passengers . That 's when I realized I was n't the only person here the hijack the plane . It seemed everybody was . I had to find a good solution . I had to get out here safely yet become a hero . I needed to get a plane , yet first it involved getting the other hijackers to give up their plans . `` I am serious '' , I started yelling . `` I will kill every single one of you , be prepared to meet my gods '' . There was a silence from the plane . `` Your gods ? `` , someone asked . `` Yes , Jane will blow up this entire plane and take you to heaven with us . '' There was some laughter from the crowd , yet panic . It was probably the dumbest line I ever said . Yet something snapped in their brains . I completely destroyed their motives . There was no goal for them , no eternal life , no virgins , just my own made up heaven -- at least that 's what I hoped they were thinking . I actually had no idea and really just needed them to calm the hell down . It somehow worked . `` If I ever have to re-tell this story I am definitely going to write a better line for that , I ca n't believe they fell for this '' , I thought . I just did n't have the time now . I needed to focus . `` I will blow all of you up ! `` , I repeated as I was walking to the cockpit . Jane brought a small , harmless bomb to open the cockpit door . `` Hurry up , Jane , blow that sucker out '' , I frantically started yelling . I was totally into this . This was going to be my moment . A small explosion followed and the door to the cockpit was open . `` Shit ! `` , I yelled as I looked at the pilot . The pilot was dead . I looked to the right , looking straight into the barrel of a gun . `` I have some bad news for you '' , the co-pilot said . `` I 'm hijacking this plane '' . `` You 've got to be kidding me '' , I said . I could n't take it anymore . Something in my head just snapped and made me feel totally out of control . I grabbed the gun and his arm . `` No , you 're not '' , I said as I looked him straight into his eyes . `` I am hijacking this plane '' . The look on his face was priceless . It was as if he saw his last glimpse of hope fly out the window and get slashed in the plane engine . I told him to land the plane . I told him to find the first airfield we could land at . And , to my very own surprise , he did . He listened . He listened very well , as if there was a gun aimed at his head . Which made sense , because at that exact moment I was aiming the gun at this head . The whole situation and the nerves just made me zone out . Jane was there with me all along , she was the one that kept me on track . `` Stay clear , Jack '' , she must 've said it a hundred times . It must have been 30 minutes before I really got back to my senses . We landed at the airfield and I got completely back in control . It was time to contact the authorities . I was too excited by this . This was the moment I had been living up to for months now , and it finally reached the end . I could see the finish line , I could taste the heroism that would overcome me in the next decades . I could see the news headlines already : `` Jack and Jane hijacked a hijacked plane ''	0.05185212194919586
It was too much . I could n't take it anymore . I heard somewhere that everyone gets a different lot in life , but everyone can work with what they have . Whoever said that was full of sh*t. Whoever said that did n't know me . They did n't feel their soul crushed every day . They did n't have my mother , my wife , my teachers , my life . `` Goodbye , cruel world . '' I picked up a stone . _________________________________________________________________ `` Mother , do you think they 'll like this song ? '' I ask myself . `` Do n't worry , babe . Mama 's gon na put all of her fears into you . Mama 's gon na make all your nightmares come true . Mama 's gon na keep Baby cosy and warm ! '' I mock , slamming another brick in the wall with each sentence . My mother was always so overprotective . `` Ca n't protect me from myself , Mother ! '' I recall the schoolmaster , back in my early years . So cruel , he was . Just like his horrid teachers . Yardsticks smacked until my knuckles turned blue and black . Individuality met with ridicule and abuse . Yelling until my ears felt loose . Punishment for poetry and rhyme , but you ca n't stop me this time ! Another brick in the wall . Rhyming out of spite , I 'd say my project 's looking tall . I 'm right in the middle of my little poem when I see a man , huddled in the snow some distance away . `` Hey , you ! Out there in the cold , getting lonely getting old , can you feel me ? '' He does n't respond . I throw down the brick in my hand and run towards him . No , this ca n't be right . He was here . But he just ... disappeared . How ? Who was he ? I was supposed to be alone behind my wall . How did he get through ? `` Hey , you ! '' I say to no one . `` Do n't help them to bury the light , '' as the sun set below my wall . `` Do n't give in without a fight ... '' I go back to my wall . After a couple good bricks known as my girlfriends throughout the years , I see another person , further away . Is that ... is that my wife ? I abandoned her when I came to build my wall ! I realize that I actually want her to be here . `` Hey , you.. '' but she 's already gone . I stand on my toes and peer over the wall . `` Open your heart , I 'm coming home ! '' I announce to the world . I try to climb over the wall , but it keeps getting higher . I see the reason why , now . It 's the man . `` Hey , you , '' I say to everyone outside the wall . `` Can you help me ? '' But they do n't hear me . The wall is finished , and the man is gone too . `` Is there anybody out there ? '' `` Is there anybody out there ? '' `` Is there anybody out there ? '' `` Is there anybody out there ? '' Suddenly , the man appears again . Through the dark , I can see his face . It 's me .	0.9999536275863647
Face barely heard the question , the nearby sound of waves pulling through pebbles had lowered them into a half meditative state , below their body.. after it . “ ….uhh ? ” squinting now , their head tilts slowly up towards this nuisance light that burns like freshly opened curtains in your childhood bedroom . “ So , how was heaven ? ” God 's voice arrived like a half pace sonic boom , absurdly loud and irritating as ever . Face knows what their in for and sighs heavily , moving their hands up to cover their eyes before lightly dragging their fingers down their face , stopping only to rest their chin on the very tips of their fingers . “ … can you ? ” “ oh… of course … . just a moment… ' God fumbles around in his smock until he finds the dial and manages to turn his aura and voice amplification down , not off , mind . “ Sorry , Face … I know you hate that. ” Eager smile like a dog at breakfast while Face is nodding off again , the flow of the sea calling him under . “ Face , please ! I got ta know , man ! What 's it like ? ” “ ..ugh ” half turn of the head and an outward stretch of the arms , Face is awake now , though dry-eyed . “ ca n't you just ... just go and look for yourself ? ” God sheepishly toes the pebbles . “ Well ... I was gon na go the other Tuesday , you know.. but I was busy . Muhammad called , him , Gandhi and Kurt- ” “ Cobain ? ” “ Russell. ” “ My bad . Carry on. ” “ Well , those guys were heading to that new six flags over by purgatory . You know , the one with the rollercoaster where it looks like your gon na plunge into lava , you get really close to the lava and you 're going crazy fast but you do n't actually go in the lava , you just miss it. ” God 's incredulous eyebrows raised beyond possibility , Face 's unequally distributed ; a cocked eyebrow the Rock 'd be proud of . “ So.. ” Face 's interest piqued “ let me get this straight . You went to ride The Lavanator , 'the hottest ride cloudside ' … . Instead… I mean… instead of finding out what all that rubbish down there , all that , I do n't even know what the hell that is , down on earth ? ... You went to six flags instead of finding that out ? …. ” “ You should see their burgers , man . I- ” “ I ca n't believe- ” “ It 's not like I have n't been there before , I invented it remember ? Built it with my own bare hands ! This cloud here , that pearly gate there . Was way quicker than earth too , only four days for heaven , a lot easier when you 're working with a more basic colour scheme . I just want to know what you thought of it , you know ? Constructive feedback. ” “ OK , OK fine . I 'll tell you how it was. ” Wily now , cogs turning at the optimum rate . “ I was a little surprised by the flowery garland I received on entrance but though 'hey , loosen up , nothing to stress about now I 'm dead . ' The sofas were incredibly comfortable and those cool little drinks holders , you know , the ones that mould to the shape of your glass , they 're a revelation ! I can tell you that right now . The food was pretty good , especially the shrimp platter which was like a religious experience , honestly , I needed a moment alone with that one. ” “ Ha , yeah . I think I had that one a few years ago , delicious… go on ... ” “ I ate that for what felt like four straight years since there are no full stomachs in heaven , no hunger either , it 's fantastic . Plus they only serve virtuous shrimp , so it 's ethically sound . After that it was time for the real business , what everyone is really here to do . The lights dim down and the music switches from choirboy hymns to some smoky improv harp . At this point winged centaurs carry especially luscious clouds topped with the most incredibly beautiful women and men into the great hall , naked as you intended them to be and beaming like the sun itself . Cherubs bring forward the massage tables and it beautifully scented oils fall lightly from above as we all take our places. ” Face is sure he could wave a hand in front of God 's eyes and he would n't even notice , so far into his imagination has he receded . “ ... but you know all of this , right ? You invented it all after all. ” ..uhh.. yeah , yeah . I know . The oil clouds were a stroke of genius , heh… let 's just say 'you 're welcome . ' “ I KNEW IT ! ” “ Umm ... knew what , Face ? ” “ You 've never even been , have you ? ! You did n't build it at all ! ” “ THEY WO N'T LET ME IN ! ” Almost in tears . “ I 've tried ! So many times but they 've got some kind of 'no deity ' rule . Apparently it 's not healthy for you humans to worship anything and they do n't want me peddling my business in there… say it will upset the equilibrium. ” “ Uh huh … I know. ” Sympathetic tones now . “ it 's just , you know , with the whole 'no time ' thing they 've got going on , they do n't really need you. ” “ … m-m-maybe you could help me , you 've been there , you could help me get in.. ” “ ..it 's just ... and I know you 're not gon na want to hear this , buddy , but I 'm just not sure you 'll ever be let in… ” “ ... but why ? ... what 's it like ? ” “ well , you see … . let me start this off simply… in heaven there is no money . At no point can you have more or less money than your fellow person . In heaven there is no property . At no point can you have a bigger or smaller house than your fellow person . In heaven , the words 'she , ' 'he , ' 'his ' 'hers ' have been abolished . There are no gender divisions , only people . In heaven there is no good or evil , no gay or straight , no class system , only people . Nationalities are as laughable as races are absurd . There are only people , hanging out , working hard for one another , letting people be what they want , when they want . There 's a lot more fruit and veg too which is a highlight , all free , of course . I 'll swap my yam for you carrots , you know… . Anyway… sorry … what I 'm trying to say is , you go in there and start throwing your weight around , trying to get everyone to look up and bow down , you will mess up the equilibrium . People believe in each other in there , they do n't need someone to fear or someone to impress or someone to keep them in check you know ... ” “ Oh … I see . ”	0.9999959468841553
`` Look kid , nobody has to be hurt alright . Just tell me where is your dad 's safe '' , said the burglar in a soft voice , trying to comfort the kid lying on his bed . `` Dad 's safe ? `` said the little kid , still half asleep , wondering if he was still dreaming . `` Yeah the place where you dad stashes all his money . I am a friend of your dad you see '' said the burglar , trying to fake an earnest smile . `` Friend ? '' said the kid with a surprise on his face . `` But dad does n't have any friend . '' `` Uhhhh I meant your dad and his wife 's . '' `` Your mum 's you know '' said the burglar . `` The house should have been empty today . The man leaves the house every friday with his kid and does n't return till the morning after . Ok no worries . The kid looks harmless anyways '' wondered the burglar , his weeks of research having obviously failed him . `` Wife ? My dad does n't have a wife . I am like his wife . '' said the kid with a dejected expression on his face . The burglar could n't help but feel disturbed after seeing the kid 's expression . He looked like somebody who had lost all hope . `` I am sure I am going to regret this but '' , wondered the burglar out loud , `` You are his wife . What do you mean ? '' `` As in I have to do his wife 's duty now . He says I have to be his wife now that mother is gone '' said the boy . `` What kind of duties '' asked the very intrigued burglar . `` Mostly cleaning the house , doing the dishes . '' said the kid `` and sometimes when he his really tired , he asks me to comfort him '' `` Comfort him ? `` `` Uhh yes . But he comforts me too you know . He says getting naked and sleeping on under him will make me smart . '' said the innocent kid . `` What ? '' 30 minutes later the burglar left the house with his latest loot but not before giving a call to the local authorities . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This is my first writing prompt .

`` Wait , '' I said , and blinked . I was standing in the exact same spot , the lamp still in my hands , the genie floating in front of me . For a moment I was n't sure if anything had changed , if I had just slipped into some fugue state for a second . Then the genie nodded to me . `` Your wish , O Mistress ? '' `` Wait , fuck , '' I said . `` You 're screwing with me . You - did you just take me back in time to before I made my wish to go back in time ? '' The genie made a little shrug . `` As you say , O Mistress . I am but a humble genie . If my future self sent you here , I am yet to know of it . '' `` Oh fuck this , '' I said , and barely restrained myself from throwing the lamp to the ground . `` You know what this is like ? This is like that guy who gets to ask one question to the smartest guy in the world . So he asks , 'What is the best question I could ask you , and what is the answer to it ? ' And then the smartass says , 'That was the best question you could have asked , and this was the answer to it . ' That asshole ! '' I flung the lamp down anyway and it bounced off the ground , leaving a dent . The genie flinched and regarded it sadly . `` That was my home , O Mistress . I shall still have to live in it . '' `` I do n't care ! '' I yelled back . `` I wanted - '' Ugh , I was so mad I was on the verge of freaking out . `` I wanted to change my biggest mistake ! And you took me back in time before I could make the wish ! I - I thought I had a chance , you piece of shit ! '' I swung at the genie and there was a burst of sparks , and the sensation of all the little hairs on my arm being singed off . `` Fuck ! Fuck ! '' It felt like an open wound dipped in alcohol . `` It 's all this recursive , pseudo-philosophical bullshit ! And the real answer is : fuck you , you 're a fucking idiot for trying ! You 're an idiot for trying to be better than yourself ! You 're an idiot for actually trying to do some good for once ! '' My eyes were stinging . `` Here 's your answer : I 'll spit in your face and pretend I 'm being wise ! '' `` Ah , '' the genie said , and reached for my arm . I kept it cramped up , holding it tight , but finally relinquished it to him . His massive hands were warm , like heating pads , and somehow driving the stinging down . `` I believe I understand , O Mistress . '' He looked at me hesitantly . `` Yeah ? '' I said . `` What ? What ? So spit it out already . '' `` That was no rebuke , O Mistress , '' he said . `` That was simply the truth of your wish . '' He released my arm and spread out his hands and grew like a bonfire , like a forest fire . Like what Moses must 've seen at the burning bush . He 'd been holding my hand . I collapsed , expecting to be swallowed whole . `` I have been gifted the boundless capacity of the universe , '' he said , and his voice echoed like a bell . `` And pressed into service of mortal souls . I am limitless potential . I am a heart 's desire . I am the burning wish of humanity made manifest . '' His burning eyes met mine . `` And now I am made yours . '' He cooled , still bright as an ember , and once more took my hand . `` No matter what you have done previously , '' he said gently , `` no matter your greatest regret , it pales in comparison to what you have yet to achieve . If you were to waste your one wish on mere regret , that would indeed be your greatest mistake . '' He released my hand and floated backwards , arms folding into position . `` That mistake has yet to be made . Your wish remains intact . '' I swallowed hard , and so as not to look at him turned my eyes to the discarded lamp . I picked it up , turning it over , seeing the dent I had made . `` I - I 'm sorry about your lamp . '' He waved it away with a smile . `` It matters not , O Mistress , '' he said , and pressed his fingers into it , smoothing it out . `` You see ? A small mistake , of little concern . Nothing that can not be fixed . '' He met my eyes . `` Now , are you prepared to make your wish ? '' I held his lamp , rubbing my thumb over the newly-smoothed surface , seeing my own reflection looking back to me . `` No , '' I said . `` I 'm not ready . Not quite yet . ''	0.0004923806409351528
The man always took this path . Just a mere 100 miles , it was the fastest way from his town to the next . With his horse he could make it in 3 days . He shrugged the bag back over his shoulder , the cold wind blowing sand in his eyes . He hated this , every second spent on the road was one second where his family , his friends , everyone that he knew , spent dying of hunger . The village head gave him the last of the town 's food and told him to get to the next town , to get food for the rest of them , to save them . His stomach growled , the pain of hunger was taking him too , albeit slowly . His mind shifted to the 2 loaves of bread in his bag . The man was tempted , but he could n't eat them . He had 2 more days to go . As he rode his horse the desert wind whipped up the sand all along his path . He could have sworn that he could make out the silhouette of animals all around him , but he knew that was impossible . Nothing had been able to live out here for centuries . The last animals had died over hundreds of years ago , right after the world had gone to hell . He shuddered . If he was n't fast enough his town would soon join them . ***** The wind grew harsher and harsher as time ticked on . A storm was coming , it seemed as if they always were . They ripped up the meager crops that the village could produce . They tore down the houses that the men in the village worked months on like paper . The man paused . His horse was exhausted . He was , too . But he could n't stop yet , if the storm hit him he would be lost in it , costing his village precious time . He had to find cover . He knew exactly where to go . ***** The giant monument was pointed to the sky . It was a reminder of times long past , times lost to the beating passage of time . The man wondered if the people of that time had problems too , if the monument was pointed to the sky to distract them of the problems down below . But he would never know . The monument which must have once gleamed in the sun was eroded by the wind , just a mountain of dirt now . Whoever had made this had died centuries ago . The village head claimed that they were made by Gods who had escaped to the stars years ago . The man thought different . These monuments were here at the time the world went to hell . It was made by his ancestors . *That* was who they were . Startled out of his thoughts by a clap of thunder in the distance , the man rode in the direction of the monument . These days it had little purpose but for shelter from the elements . The man shuddered , it mattered not who made the monument . All that was left behind from them now were broken pieces of their culture and a world in ruin . The man rode on , the storm was getting stronger . He was the last hope of his people .	4.483424163481686e-06
Death . Death comes for us all . Except for me , of course . I am immortal . I am the watcher . And I do n't much care . Quantum manipulation . Magic . Now , the Culling of the Branches . This almost feels like a story . A weird story , patched with fanfiction . Right now everyone thinks the universe started with the Big Bang . No . Azathoth dreamed all of this . There was never a Big Bang . Everyone thinks the worst person who ever lived was Hitler . No . It was Randolph Carter , the mad scientist who tore reality apart . Hitler was merely fiction back then . A fiction , from a story named 'Mein Kamph ' . That book was pretty popular , mainly because it detailed the life of a man under overwhelming stresses , eventually cracking to the pressures and becoming a fascist dictator . You know , there used to be a book by a certain M.O.Ses . Merlin Osil Ses . It detailed the fictional Great Old One known as Yahweh . I 'm sure you all know about it , since he is worshipped now . The black void is thick with uncertainty . Scientists right now has figured a law known as Quantum Uncertainty . It used to be the Theory of Nyarlathotep , which was named after the Pharaoh-Scientist , Nyarlathotep , who also discovered the Outer God of Intelligent Design , who the Pharoah named 'Nyarlathotep ' as well . There were a few myths about the Pharoah . Some say he is an avatar of the Outer God of the same name . However , nowadays , the Pharoah , and his Outer God , were both discredited , for you can not have intelligence if you lack any conceivable goal . Nyarlathotep gains nothing for toying with us . That much I can be certain of . The Outer Gods have no politics . No politicians . His very nature is alien to this universe . I can understand Azathoth , but not Nyarlathotep . Perhaps I should analyze him further . He makes no sense . Nyarlathotep is strange among the Outer Gods , since he seems to be ascended from a lower state of matter , rather than descended from a higher state of energy . Kind of like the difference between a mod that become a game , and the games that becomes mods . Well , that is the best explanation I can give that will not tear the untrained mind , anyway . For those of you who know , it is more akin to the result of a program modifying highest-level code in the program , completely changing it , and still somehow functioning and moving and doing all sorts of things , rather than a programmer inserting it in . Nyarlathotep might just embody evolution , though evolution is n't really a very high-level behavior . -- -- -- Let us get even further back . Once upon a time , I used to be a flutist . A very good flutist . I played with the drummers , mainly because I wanted to . Azathoth , being Azathoth , continued to snore . However , through his snoring , I managed to piece the pieces together . Some pieces , mind you . Mainly Quantum Warping and other things that I use everyday . How I got to Azathoth is another tale to be told . You want to hear the tale ? Here it is . I was just an ordinary person . A magician , with the usual 5-fingered hands , two arms , two legs . Yes , I was completely ordinary . There is nothing weird about me . No , I 'm not secretly a yellow orb of energy assuming corporal form . I used to manipulate strands of things . Other stuff too . Then I made a portal . The portal changed my life forever . I wo n't get into the details , though . I do n't want you to do that thing . Besides , it 's too long . It would serve as a tale for later . -- -- -- So anyway , I peered within Azathoth , and I saw some code within . Azathoth , you see , is made of code . A lot of lines of it , constantly receiving input and output and other things . Some people see him as some weird tentacled being , though . I guess that is because tentacles are code . I do n't know for sure , though . I used the knowledge , to , well , acquire some food . Uranium-235 cakes , slowly decaying , are filling ( though I miss sugar ) enough to sustain my reality-warping energy to acquire better food . After which , I am a lost of what to do . Maybe I should meet Zkauba , and tell him of whatever I want to tell him about . cont .	0.9999958276748657
The shadows grew taller until they reached into my room , and the light of the world faded around me . I sat motionless in the dark , and a sorrowful breath escaped my lips . I fucked up again . I thought she would be different . Sure , I might have came across as a bit shy , but who does n't ? I caught her smiles so many times I could n't even count , each one unique like a snowflake . She sent me winks , compliments and wishes - which I tried my best and more to try and fulfill them . But I was wrong . Maybe I had read it wrong , or maybe she did n't know me - either way , I was once again banished to the realm of the forsaken friendzone , with nothing but a cold emptiness emanating from my heart . The thunder flashed outside , startling me slightly . 'Terrific . ' I thought . It seemed that even the weather was bringing me down . There was another flash , but this time , I did not hear the thunder . Instead , I heard whispers that entered my ears like some slimy snake , leaving an unpleasant feeling in my mind . My teeth clenched as I realized I had heard this before , but I could not remember when . What was it ? Was it during the 14th birthday ? Was it during last Christmas ? What was it ? As if to answer my question , something black and dusty exploded in front of me , causing me to be blown back into my bed . The figure materialized steadily , and I could make out image through the silhouette . It was a woman , wearing a dark pointed hat , with hair black as a street cat 's , with a robe that unified the colors . She blinked , her blue , hollow eyes glowing in the dark , and then shifted her gaze on me . I had barely enough time to recover myself when she stormed in front of me and grabbed me by the shirt . `` You ! '' She shrieked . An explosion of black smoke hissed out of her mouth as she spoke . `` W-what ? '' I stammered . I raised my hands in a surrendering gesture , but it had little effect . `` We had a deal ! '' `` Who are you ? '' I asked . She was then silent - but only for a split second . To my surprise , she released me , and clicked her fingers . In an instant , a piece of paper materialized in front of her . `` Four years ago . December the fifth . At the party . '' She stated . I carefully took the paper from her slim , bony hands , and looked over it cautiously . I was surprised to find that I could read the letters quite accurately , despite being in the dark . My face changed to confusion when I realized what the paper had said . I was to promise her me firstborn , in exchange for musical talent . Trying my best not to offend her , even taking into consideration that she may be offended by the way I looked at her , I extended the paper back to her . She snatched it without a word . `` I do n't understand . '' I said in my best feeble voice . `` You promised me your firstborn ! '' She shrieked again . The room was getting darker each time her mouth was open . `` I did ! '' I protested . `` It 's not my fault I ca n't get any girls ! '' I clenched my teeth at my protest , as I had put in more passion to the tone without realizing it . To my surprise however , the witch was taken back . `` Wait what ? '' She asked . I sighed , and showed her computer . `` Look . '' I pointed . The witch peered at the screen with narrowed eyes , and began scrolling through my chat log . I did not bother reading it again , and instead found entertainment in her reactions . Her face changed from a dreamy smile , to a raised eyebrow , to an approving look , to a grimace . She then looked at me , and scratched her head . `` In five years , she 's the only one you 've been talking to ? I mean , there has to be others right ? '' She asked . I sighed again , but added a shrug . `` But ... Why ? '' She asked me . I opened my mouth to speak - my intended answer was to be something melancholy and gentlemanly , but I closed my mouth . I felt a strange anger bubble out from inside me , and I felt the cork pulverize into dust as the fiery emotions exploded out into verbal form . `` I do n't fucking know ! '' I shouted . The witch was more taken back then before , and this time it was her turn to collapse on my bed . `` I mean , I 'm not even that bad looking right ? '' I looked at her with eyes of anger , rather than of desperation . The witch gulped and nodded . Her eyes then caught the bottle of liquor next to my monitor . `` I mean , I 'm a nice guy , I do n't treat woman badly - hell I do n't even insult them ! '' I carried on . I felt my face turn red , but I refused to believe it was the alcohol . `` But what happens ? Nothing ! Absolutely goddamn nothing ! I asked twenty three girls out - after getting to know them , know their favorite colors , their hobbies , their favorite movies , their favorite music - hell , I even found a girl that likes Heavy Metal like me , and what happens ? Nothing ! '' The witch nervously stood up and began muttering something under her breath . `` I even skipped going out to my friend 's birthday party to hang with this other chick by the way , and she just told me that she wanted to be friends . It 's always with the friendship ! She 's got a million friends on facebook for crying out loud ! '' The witch began fading into black smoke , but it was slow . She began muttering faster , while looking at me and nodding with a static look . `` Hell , if she wanted friends she should be a goddamn Carebear ! I 've wasted so much of my time doing this - I do n't even know if - `` I never finished my rant , as I was interrupted by another loud explosion of smoke , to which I was knocked back from my chair . I thumped my head hard on the desk and I cursed , grasping at the back to ease the pain . I looked up to see the witch , but she was gone . I sighed for the third time , and rose to my feet . The light flickered , and were illuminated again , lighting the darkness of my room . And with a weak stumble , I collapsed into the chair and stared back at the monitor . And once again , I surrendered my eyes to the internet world , and my mind switched off as warriors , gangsters , cats , girls and cartoons flashed past me , easing the pain of my defeat .	0.999995231628418
The storm flung towering pillars of sand against the walls of the cabin , rattling the windows in their flimsy frames and sending waves of dust through the gap beneath the door . We crouched in the far corner , hunkered down between the beds , and watched a barrage of leaves and debris plaster themselves against the glass . No one spoke . We sat in spiritual silence , Pa 's jaw grinding slowly back and forth on itself the way it did in church when the priest took too long with the homily . Ma held my sister , rocking her back and forth . I could tell it was as much to soothe Ma 's fears as Jenny 's . The wind had a voice . It screamed at us to flee , to seek more substantial cover , but we had nowhere else to go . Three years ago , I 'd seen my first tornado , a black funnel the size of a city that fell out of the swirling sky in the east . Lightning cracked the air around it . I 'd never been able to shake the feeling that it was only a matter of time before the funnel returned and swallowed me up . A blast of wind hit the cabin from the side and clattered the pots and pans that hung along the wall . Startled by the noise , I glanced in that direction and saw a dark shape flash past the window . Suddenly it was very cold in the cabin . I clutched my knees to my chest , staring out the window , trying to glimpse something -- anything -- to help me attach a rational explanation to the shape . It was no use . The billowing dust obscured everything more than a foot from the windows . We might as well have been the last people on a plague-ravaged Earth , sitting out the final storm . I became aware of a sound along the wall behind me . Straining to hear it over the howling wind , I pressed an ear against the wood . *Tap tap . Tap tap TAP TAP TAP* My heart slammed a breakneck rhythm . I tugged Pa 's sleeve and leaned to shout in his ear : `` I think there 's something out there ! '' He gave me a sharp look that softened almost immediately , the wrinkles around his eyes regaining their normal grooves of cheer . `` There is something out there , '' he shouted back . `` It 's called a dust storm !

They told me this was an incredible honor . That I will die for humanity , for the sake of science . That I 'm leaving a legacy behind and I will forever go down in history . Yet here I stand , with proof that it was all a lie . All those faces , I will never forget . Young , old , women , men , even children , with bright futures ahead of them , all dead in the name of science . Who 's to say I wo n't just be another face in the big book of dead people ? I stepped onto the platform and felt the movement of the swarm of subatomic particles whizzing around underneath me . I could literally see the eerie blue shimmer of the Cherenkov radiation deep down under , near the depths of the bottomless pool . Apparently they 've never gotten this far before . Then came the weird high-pitched humming noise . This is it . *Charles died that day , just one out of thousands of victims the machine claimed over the years of the experiment . Theorists argue the fusion reaction took place as expected , just in a parallel universe . Further experiments will be needed to confirm*	6.114118150435388e-05
The weather was nice at this time of year in Moscow . It was mid-summer and president Barack Hussein Obama was on a diplomatic visit in the Kreml to discuss the reduction in the two countries ' respective nuclear arsenals . Mostly , the whole thing was for show for the press , to give the media some nice photos to put on their covers . Well , their 5th or 6th pages at least . The important things were left to both countries ' military and foreign ministries . After some long speeches , standing behind podiums , the formalities were done and Obama stood next to Putin , as the two shook hands , talked and posed for the cameras . At this point , of course , Obama knew that it hardly mattered what he said . It was at this point , that something came to his mind . He had asked his Russia advisor for some phrases he could use in their language . So he said to Putin : `` You know , I have learned some things since we last met . Let me see , if I get this right . `` , and then , in broken Russian : `` [ The weather is nice ] '' . The shocked , pale face of Putin was the last thing he saw , because he had accidentaly said a predetermined save word , that the Russian head of state was given in case something went disastrously wrong . It caused a Russian secret service agent to shoot the U.S. President and put the military in high alert ( because of the retaliation that was sure to come ) , while Putin was hurriedly rushed away , constantly saying in Russian : `` No , no , this is a mistake '' . Meanwhile , the U.S. saw this as a declaration of war and started mobilizing it 's troops as well . Hundreds of thousands of phones rang as all U.S. reserve troops were called into service and everyone working for the government overall called into office . In Europe and other allied countries , both for Russia and the U.S. , the same happened . At this point , disaster could still have been averted , if in china , there had n't been a sack of rice that fell over . It fell on the Russian ambassadors ' head , who was just minding his own business shopping , which made China think there had been a political assassination on chinese soil , made by the CIA . This , in addition to the fear of no one standing up to the U.S. and its ' allies in the future if Russia lost , caused them to join the Russian side and , in overeagerness , retaliate against U.S. ambassadors and citizens , holding them hostage in exchange for their own . This provocation caused the U.S. to declare war on China and Russia , seeing no viable alternative at this point , followed suit .	0.9999958276748657
`` Hey , are you busy today ? '' She floats at her usual spot - the intersection of 12th Street and Independence Avenue . Probably a traffic accident , and not too long ago - her clothes look like they 're from the 21st century . I shake my head . After twenty-three days of the same question , and the same answer , by now I thought she would have learned to stop asking . `` Sorry , I 've got to get to work . '' Sure , I feel guilty , but then again , serving as a psychotherapist for the deceased was a pro bono line of work , and as a recent college graduate struggling to keep an apartment in Washington D.C. , it 's something that I ca n't afford to do . She is there again the next day . `` Hey , are you busy today ? '' Honestly , my supervisor was fairly lenient - he would n't mind if I came in late one day . Simply , the truth of the matter was that I did n't want to listen to her sob story . About how she should have been more careful crossing the road , about her wasted potential , about how she wished the living would take the time to truly *live* . I 've heard that lecture a million times . It 's kind of funny how almost every ghost has the same regrets . I open my mouth , and the words come out automatically . `` Sorry , I 'm running late to work . '' It 's kind of become a familiar routine at this point . I 'll swipe my metro card , exit the turnstile , and catch a glimpse of her wispy figure . She 'll look up with a hopeful half-smile , and I 'll shake my head . Before she 's even asked the question , she already has her answer , but she asks it anyways , and as always , I give her my perfunctory reply . But Monday , May 2nd , is different . I swipe my metro card , exit the turnstile , look up - and she is not there . The rest of the week passes by in a confused blur . On Thursday , I go to the Smithsonian metro station thirty minutes early and wait around , searching for her familiar black-and-white skater dress . Nothing . Ghosts do n't simply disappear . Sure , they 're able to travel around , but almost all of the ones that I 've met before stick to their favorite haunts . And , now that she is gone , the contrarian in me wants to hear what she had to say . Saturday morning . I do n't have work today , but I still make the trip to the Smithsonian . Hopefully she is n't too far - after all , she 's had a week . At this point , she could be miles away from the D.C. area . Still , it ca n't hurt to try . It 's late afternoon when I settle into a bench at Malcolm X Park with nothing to show for my efforts . A scowling businessman scoffs at me as he marches on by , briefcase in hand . Going into work on a Saturday - the poor fellow probably has n't even realized he 's dead yet . Closing my eyes for a brief moment , I try to think of something , *anything* , that could give me a lead on where she might be . But there was nothing . I 'd just always dismissed her , every single time - twenty-four days in a row . `` You look like you could use somebody to talk to . '' My eyes snap open . It 's not her . The voice had already clued me in on that , but I wo n't deny that a small piece of me hoped that it would be . Instead , a woman around my grandmother 's age stood before me . Another member of ghostly society . Sometimes , it seems as though I speak more with spirits than with the living . The woman smiled at me , the lines around the edges of the her eyes crinkling like candy wrappers . `` Care to talk ? '' I shrugged . After all , it was my refusal to talk to a ghost that got me in this quandary in the first place . Perhaps talking to one would be able to fix it . `` Sure , why not ? ''	0.9999858140945435
Dear my beloved mother , I 'm writing to you on this cold Christmas eve . I know you wo n't receive this letter by morning but regardless please wish a merry Christmas to Micheal and David as well as the lads back in Cornwall on my behalf as soon as possible . I hope your having an excellent dinner , writing this i can already smell Davids Sunday roast , oh how i would give my left arm for a taste of Yorkshire pudding right about now , anything but the rubbish they serve the troops really . I just want you all to know i miss you all very much , i had to hold back my tears when we set sail across the channel , I was connived the smile you gave me as we left would be last i ever saw . You were so worried to see me leave , How could i blame you ? the war has claimed many brave men so far . But do n't worry mother , the war is n't all that bad , in fact it 's been lovely so far ! When we marched to position i was afraid we would be met with German shelling but to my surprise there was no shelling to be heard . We were notified upon arriving at the trenches by a seasoned artillery officer that we 've struck a truce with the Germans , and for the time being we 're allowed to exchange pleasantries and gifts between the men . I spent the day conversing and playing football on the Belgium farmland , those Germans are a lot better with a ball than you 'd expect i have to say so myself . later that evening we all sat down for a Christmas eve dinner , the food was n't anything special , not like back home but better than i would have expected . we shared stories as i got to know 2 brothers from Rostock . I myself have never heard of the place but it sounded very lovely . As the night went on we shared pints and sang songs to warm our bodies having an all around great time . I believe mother joining the army may have been the best decision I 've made . I 'm making friends and for once i feel part of something beigger than my life on the farm . I heard stories of the horrors of the front and the brutality of the Germans . Yet upon arrival I 've Never in my life been met with such enthusiasm and support from common-folk , and from the Germans of all people ! I 'm now laying in my quarters , an area dug out from under the trenches , new recruits are required to do night-watch on there first night but after such a lovely day i really ca n't complain . I just want you to know that i 'm very happy here , I 've made friends and for once feel involved . Hopefully the whole war will go on this pleasantly , i 'm beginning to see how what we 've been told about the war is a load of rubbish . This has been the most warming , pleasant day of my entire life ! so much so i might be a little sad upon returning home . All i wanted to say is that you do n't have to worry mother , it 's not as dangerous as it 's been told . I have yet to hear a shell all day and can only expect the best ! I 'll be home before you know it and i 'll have some incredible stories to share ! Love you mother . I hope to see you soon . Sincerely , your son , private Danial .	0.9999959468841553
`` Do it , coward , '' the voice in his head urges . And he does . Suddenly , he is thrown into another world . He sees himself , walking , shaking hands , receiving his papers , walking away in deep blue robes and laughing in victory . He sneers and then is ripped away , swirling , lost in color as a new scene comes into focus . A woman . Long , brunette hair . High cheek bones . Deep blue eyes the color of the Aegean in spring . The woman giggles , laughing at some unheard joke . He ca n't help but smile ... `` Who ... '' The world spins and he is torn away again , This time to a storm in a forest . The drumming of the rain drowns out all other sound . Another man is yelling , but ca n't be heard . Suddenly the voice cuts through the wet splashing . `` RUN . '' He follows the man 's instructions , a sense of overwhelming dread flowing over him . An unnoticeable tree stump grabs a hold of his foot , hurling him into the mud . This is the end . He ca n't bear it . Just as the dread is about to drown him he flashes to another scene . The woman is there , and the yelling man too . `` What ... '' `` Bout time you woke up ! '' The woman giggles and he feels the smile bubbling to his face again . He jumps forward . The woman is still there , but older now . Lines have appeared in her forehead , as well as curves around her mouth and little crinkles next to her eyes . Still , she retains all of her beauty . `` We 're going to be late for the graduation ! '' Now she is lying in a bed . Beep . She wears nothing but a robe . Beep . Much older now , the lines are thicker . And her hair is grey . There are strange machines around , a symphony of beeps and clicks and whirs and wooshes . Beep . People outside the room seem busy , rushing to and fro . Beep . `` It does n't hurt , '' she croaks quietly . She closes her eyes , as the beeps grow further apart . Beep . She mutters something else , `` I ... . love ... you . '' ... ... ... ... a tear rolls from his eye as he realizes the mistake he has made . `` NO ! '' he screams , but it is too late . The gun clicks .	0.9999951124191284
This place is beautiful in the winter . My first deployment to Afghanistan was back in 2023 . Hardly a decade after the withdrawal of American combat units from the first Afghan campaign – a conflict sparked by the public outcry for justice in the the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks – ethnic Uzbek and Tajik separatists in the north of the country declared themselves for Abdul Rashid Dostum , warlord of Balkh province and one of the preeminent generals of the Northern Alliance that had fought against the Taliban in the late 1990 ’ s . Unhappy with what he saw as a corrupt central government in Kabul that ignored the grievances of the northern territories while blithely exploiting its staggering mineral riches , Dostum called in his retainers and , seemingly overnight , consolidated an army of hardened fighters against the central government . Their goal , Dostum claimed , was to follow in the footsteps of the still-young Islamic Republic of Kurdistan and establish a sovereign state that had direct control over its own mineral and petroleum reserves , as well as – of course – the profits from their sale . With the growing conflict threatening Western mining interests in the region , the United States was forced to broker a ceasefire between Kabul and the separatist forces led by Dostum . I was part of the first wave of peacekeeping forces sent to the country as part of the terms of the ceasefire agreement . In return for Dostum ’ s peaceful withdrawal from the capital , Kabul agreed to administer the northern territories as a special autonomous region with its own government centered at Mazar-e-Sharif , Dostum ’ s seat of power . We were there to ensure the peaceful transition of power , and to oversee what was to become the new government ’ s first democratic elections . I was only a private then . When I wasn ’ t digging ditches or fixing radar and navigation equipment on our helicopters , I was on guard duty . I didn ’ t mind it much , really . You get a hell of a view from some of those guard towers . Now , don ’ t get me wrong . The landscape there is nothing but boring , brown , and bland on its bad days , and God knows there are plenty of those . But on its good days , it ’ s gorgeous enough to take your breath away . I remember taking my post at one of the south-facing guard towers one morning early January . It had rained all day and night before , and by the time I rolled out of my cot and made my way to my station it was cold enough that the parts of the ground that weren ’ t muddying up my boots were covered in a thin , lightly crunching layer of frost . The darkness of early morning obscured everything but the distant lights of vehicles convoying their way back to base after long overnight patrols . But when my eyes finally adjusted to the slowly growing sunlight peaking over the foothills to the east , I was mesmerized by what the light of dawn revealed . The precipitation from the day before had transformed the dull , listless range of mountains to our south – barren of anything but dried-brown dust and craggy rocks – into magnificent snow-covered massifs towering over our sprawling encampment as if to swallow us whole . “ This is what it must feel like to face a tsunami , ” I thought . The ground , which only yesterday had been painted with the same powder-brown dust that plagued the mountains , had sprouted into a thin but vibrant layer of green that spread far out in every direction until it reached the horizon or touched the base of the foothills . The short , straggly blades of grass defiantly pushing out of the frostbitten earth had appeared overnight , in the dead of winter , as if by magic . And it really was magic , every bit as much then as it is now . But this time , things are different . This time , even the magic of the Afghan landscape can do nothing to assuage the cold , prying dread and suffocating fear of what is to come . There is nothing that can ; not at this point ; not since the First Contact , and in the days that immediately followed , when – for the first time – we fully understand what it was going to cost us . This is a fitting place to make our stand . It is Afghanistan , after all – deadly as it is beautiful . This is where conquerors , gods , and empires come to die . And by this time tomorrow , I may very well add my bones to this grave . ( To Be Continued ... )	0.9999959468841553
`` Two yesterday . Decided they wanted a piece of my garden . How about you , Kenneth ? '' I looked up from my notepad , my attention yanked suddenly to the conversation at hand . `` I uh ... What ? '' `` How many have you killed this week ? '' I shrugged , feeling a distinct rush from the lie I was about to tell . `` Not sure . Five or six , I suppose . '' The three others stared at me . `` Six ? Really ? '' I nodded . `` Well , or five . I said five too . I do n't really remember . '' Ferd hopped off the hood of the car he 'd been sitting on . `` Uh huh . And that 's why you 've gotten all red , I 'm sure . How old are you , Kenneth ? '' I sighed . `` Nearly twelve . Why 's it matter ? '' `` Ha ! By twelve I 'd had at least a dozen kills under my belt . Sister was the first . '' Chip shouted proudly . He was sixteen , the oldest in our group . `` So what ? '' I retorted indignantly . `` Not like I 've never killed a zombie before . '' The others blinked at me . `` Oh my god , '' Chelsea muttered . `` You 've never killed a zombie have you ? '' I shook my head , feeling the inevitable blush rising in my face . My signature tell and not a thing I could do about it . Still , I persisted . `` Sure I have ! I love killing zombies . I love ... smushing their heads in , you know . Like big bags of.. sand . '' I made a squishing motion with my hands , driving home my point . Chip nearly doubled over laughing . `` Bags of sand ! ? Are you serious ? '' Ferd walked to the overhang where I 'd been taking shelter from the heat . `` What are you drawing there , Ken ? '' `` I , uh.. - Hey ! '' Before I had a chance to react he 'd grabbed the book from me and climbed the nearest bus , waving it above his head . `` OOohh , look at this ! Some sort of shitty little sword ! How cute ! Hey Chip , you think we can start using swords to kill zombies now ? '' The others began laughing too and I felt a burning sensation start to sting my eyes . I knew the feeling ; I was about to cry . So I ran . I turned tail , leaving my precious pen and notepad . They 'd been my two dearest friends for as long as I could remember and I left them without a second thought . The worst part is that I left them to avoid *more* embarrassment . As if there would ever be a way to redeem myself . I sprinted past the rows of cars , following the highway as far as it would take me . Before long my sprint became a jog and my jog became a saunter . By the time the sun had begun setting I was strolling lazily along . Some part of me wanted Chip , Ferd and Chelsea to chase after me but they 'd probably moved on already . Kids joined and left on a daily basis , some voluntarily and others , well ... . My stomach growled . A sign listed the nearest town : Alamosa , 12 miles . And that 's when I saw her . A little girl , missing one arm , trying to open the door of a car . It looked like she wanted nothing more than to get inside , but could n't quite muster the movements required to clutch the handle . I looked at her , then behind me to ensure no one had chased after me . After I was satisfied , I approached her . Slowly at first was the rule with these things . Make a sudden movement and they would lunge at you . But as I walked up to her , I realized why she wanted so badly to enter the car . *Her pet . * She turned to look at me , her dead eyes scanning me before turning back to the door . I reached forward , edging my hand around her left side so that she would have to turn in order to grab me . I felt the handle and tugged it lightly . Gravity did the rest and the door swung open . I retreated as slowly as I 'd approached , watching the girl 's motions . She made her way inside , oblivious to my presence and curled up next to a dog 's rotting carcass . Finally content , her eyes closed and she appeared to sleep . I knew that was it for her . She shivered in her final moments , the same way my parents had after lying down next to me . My kill count remained at zero because after all this time I could n't bring myself to harm the otherwise peaceful creatures . I knew I could tell the others about this , tell them I 'd murdered a zombie in cold blood . But that would n't change the truth and it would n't change them . I had yet to meet someone who understood the dead the way I did . That was alright , though . I was only twelve then . I had plenty of time to search . > /r/mspaintshoops	0.9999927282333374
Have you ever felt alone in a crowd ? Ever been in a mall or on a bus , just minding your own business , when you 're suddenly , inescapably struck with a feeling of isolation ? The people around you stop being people - they 're not like *you* . How could they be ? How could they feel anything like the way you do , be anything like the way you are ? They do n't know what 's happening in your mind , and how could they ? It 's in these moments that you stop , just for a moment , and realize just how alone you really are . Human beings , minds separated by just a few feet of meat , bone and air , and yet they might as well be on opposite sides of the Earth . Have you ever felt that way ? If you have , I imagine it passed as quickly as it came on . You pause , look around , seize upon some detail about one of the apes around you . The girl on the train staring out the window at the black , rushing walls of the tunnel ; what does she see ? The child sitting , obstinate , on the stairs of library , mother or father cajoling , trying to get on with whatever minutia it is that they call their lives . You see these things , and it jars you - you can recognize what 's happening before your eyes , relate to it , wonder about these people surrounding you - and they are people , once again , not just apes - and you realize that yes , you are one of them . You do these things . I do n't . I look around and I can only see apes . I can only see their faces , their bodies , their *meat* . There 's no humanity there , no kindness , no communion . I go to movies , alone , and I sit in the dark . I watch the characters on the screen , and I watch the other theatre-goers . They stare at the pictures , intent . A monster leaps out , frightens the protagonists ; the movie watchers startle , clutch at one another and then , remembering that it 's all a farce , glance at each other and smile , reassured . The characters fall in love , pledge themselves to one another , and the watchers smile , clasp their neighbours ' hands . The movie ends and the lights come on ; they file out together , laughing , into the sunlight . I 've seen a lot of movies . I 've never had a neighbour . If I try , if I really try , I can look like one of them , act like one of them . I do it some days , commit myself to a persona drawn , more or less , from a hat . Who am I today ? Am I the funny man , with his jokes and easy smile ? Or will I be the asshole today , who swears at the slightest provocation , who scowls at everyone who dares to meet his eyes ? Perhaps I 'll be the lover , visiting the florist for a bouquet of red roses - that one is a challenge ; the shopkeeper knows all about my beloved , and to keep the charade I must hold two people in my head at once : myself , and the man I profess to adore . There is no man , of course . No woman , either , for that matter . I 'm not funny , not angry , not in love . I just am ; all of these things , and none , all at once . And I am alone .	0.00040632724994793534
When Artigan saw the a wisp of smoke rise from the forest cover , the chill that went through his spine had nothing to do with the hint of coming snow in the air . He picked up the pace and walked toward the source of the smoke . Was it another hiker ? Or maybe two ? The evening air suddenly felt more alive , almost electric . The anticipation made his mouth water and the shivering feeling in his stomach made it difficult for him to breathe . He was feeling giddy with the prospect of a kill on the hill . The garotte in his pocket was like a living thing and he patted it with a loving touch . `` Soon , my lovely . Soon . '' When he reached the fire , he was slightly disappointed to see it was just one man instead of two . For a moment he wondered who the hell treks alone . But then he realized that he was trekking alone too . `` Hey , hello there , '' Artigan said to the man who sat on a log with his back toward him . The man did n't move . He just kept his hands extended towards the fire . `` Hello , Artigan . Please join me . '' Artigan paused . The man knew his name . Which meant the man knew about him and what he did . Artigan thought about his choices , he could turn and go back where he had come from or he could join the man and find out how he knew his name before slicing his head off and eating his brain . His curiosity got the best of him and he walked up to the small fire . The man looked up to him and Artigan saw that his face was criss crossed with scars . Jagged wounds that had long healed but left their marks . When the man smiled , his pointed canines shone like diamonds in the semi darkness . Artigan felt a strange mixture of revulsion , lust and happiness in his chest . This was no one else but The Cross . The famous serial killer who crossed the faces of his victims after killing them . Artigan was not only a fan of the man but he positively idolized him . And he knew Artigan 's name ! And now Artigan had the opportunity to take his idol 's head ! Could this evening get any better ? He extended his hand towards the man who had earned a reputation based on unrivaled violence in the serial killer community . He was almost the level of a senior . A legend ! `` Sir , big big fan of your work . You 've been a true inspiration for my work . '' The man did n't take his hand . `` But , you , Artigan , you 've been a disgrace to our community . It 's people like you who give our work a bad name . '' Shit , thought Artigan as the man clasped his hand in his iron grip and a flash of steel from his other hand swung towards Artigan 's face . He flinched and that saved his life . The trademark serrated knife in Cross ' hand nearly scrapped through his eyeball . He had the garotte out in a flash , and he swung the weighed end around the other man 's neck . The choking sound he heard meant he had looped perfectly and now it was all about raw strength . He pulled the wire and Cross freed his hand to try and get his fingers under the garotte . But his other hand still had the knife and now he was also closer to Artigan . The knife flashed again and again in the falling darkness , and Artigan felt the sharp bite of the blade on his neck , face and chest . Blood filled his mouth but he managed to grab the other end of the garotte . He pulled and sliced with all his might and felt the wire bite into the flesh and tissue of the neck . The sharp tang of blood filled his nostrils , the same familiar feeling he had enjoyed so many times before . But his strength was fading . cross still jabbed at him with the wicked knife but his jabs had lost the will behind them . The two killers fell on the ground as fatigue and blood loss caught up with them . The first snow of winter started to fall and Artigan smiled at the numbness that was spreading through his body . He had had his kill . That was all that mattered .	0.9999569654464722
I was browsing reddit , in my college cafeteria . My morning scone was overcooked , as usual . Scrolling through some nsfw posts I look over my shoulder only to be punched in the mouth by a rather brutish looking ruffian in the stereotypical `` southern auto mechanic '' outfit , with one major difference , he had a cape on . He continued peppering me with blows until I felt myself beginning to pass out . With one last burst of strength I punched back . But instead of a curled mass of fingers hitting this man , a flail of sorts hit him . This flail was rather unconventionally shaped ... and to my discomfort I realized it resembled a dildo . Upon closer inspection I realized that my hand had indeed morphed into a large , dense , dildo . `` Did you just hit me with a dildo ? '' he asked , seemingly insulted . `` I ... I guess , yeah '' I stammered , unsure of what was happening . `` Awww man that shit 's weird man '' he replied . He got up , and walked away , his face flushed . I looked back at my hand , and was relieved to see that the phallus had turned back into my familiar hand , complete with five normal fingers . `` Well ... .stranger things have happened '' i thought to myself , and just like that got back to browsing the internet .	0.9999959468841553
Overall the idea is solid , and the style fits the plot . It has the feel of a fairy-tale with its narrative style . There are a few things I noticed right off the bat . In the first paragraph you used the word `` poor '' four times in three sentences . I would suggest maybe varying it , > He lived in the poor part of the city , for he was poor . He made clothes for poor workers , and was paid very little for even his best work . He was poor , but he was happy . An alternative could be : * He lived in the slums of the city , for he was hard on money . He made clothes for workers like him , and was paid very little even for his best work . He was poor , but he was happy . * If you change your words every so often it keeps the reader 's interest that little bit longer . I notice that you use the word `` poor '' a few more times in the story , so try playing around with vocabulary each time . In your third paragraph , you use parenthesis . This is n't a bad thing , but in most stories , one would try to avoid using them . I would try incorporating it into the story , so instead of > He was so extremely tired when he went into his bedroom ( which was just above his shop ) , but as soon as he lay down , he immediately felt wide awake . You could say : *He was so extremely tired when he went to his room above the shop* I found this sentence awkward in a few other ways as well . The phrasing `` he was so extremely tired '' leaves me expecting the continuation * ... that [ blank ] happened* . It would be a good idea to either split the sentence in two or change *He was so extremely tired* to *He felt his exhaustion* . The sentence would feel smoother that way as you lead into the *but as soon as he lay down* . There are a few more sentences that bug me , but I ca n't quite put my finger on them . A saw one that was borderline a run-on sentence in your last paragraph ( *No ... In reality , he was Mr. Alexander Black* ) As a few last notes , I would probably expand the paragraph with the dream . In both your intro and concluding paragraph you bring back the idea of food , shelter and warmth . The first time with him being content with his meager lifestyle , the second time with what was once satisfactory not being enough anymore . I like the shift from the positive to downcast , but the dream with the fine red and gold cloak does n't quite fit the theme that you established . So , if possible , try to bring the idea of food , shelter and warmth into the dream . What did the king eat that was better ? How was the king 's bed better ? How was the fireplace better ? Answering these questions would make a greater contrast to his life and tie the dream into the rest of the story a bit better . It would certainly explain why the tailor woke up and suddenly was n't satisfied with his way of life anymore . I hope this critique is n't too harsh . Like I said , you 've got a solid story . If you make any changes ( even if they are n't my suggestions because let 's be honest , I 'm no expert ) , let me know . I 'll be happy to read it again .	0.0003682266396936029
I 've always had dreams that were ... off . I could n't explain them to anyone while I was younger , my parents thought I was just fantasizing , my friends thought I was insane . But as I grew older , I realized that I could explain the dreams if I only gave proof of their authenticity . This realization in itself was a mistake . The first person I told , I saw on a train , about to be blown to bits . When I saw them in the waking world , I warned them about their future . They did n't believe me , and died as a result . The second person I told , I saw them on a roof , about to jump . I warned them about their future , and a day later I saw a news story about a man jumping from a roof . It was five years before I had the next dream . I saw myself , with a gun held to my own head . As I awoke , I had the urge to warn someone , but had no one to warn . I then realized the terrifying truth . The people I warned did n't die because they did n't believe me , they died because their minds could n't handle the unwavering truth that I had given them . With this realization , I pressed the barrel to my head , and pulled the trigger . You may be wondering how you 're reading this , if I 'm dead . I would suggest that you do a reality check .	0.0012025543255731463
Everyone waited with baited breath as Rosenfel thought for a few minutes . Suddenly the assembler sprung into life creating and destroying works of art in moments . Each one more fabulous than the last . Some of the crowd faint at the beauty of the items created , while others storm out as it creates things that are far beyond what they could have possibly imagined . Finally the assembler stops and the remaining people scurry forwards vying to get a better view . Sitting on the assemblers base is an easel with a blank canvas and a set of brushes and paints , a potters wheel with a lump of fresh clay with tools and a block of Marble with a hammer and chisels . Shaking their heads , the audience leaves . For the computer has indeed created the perfect work of art .	0.999995231628418
When the mist eyed man entered the shop and began flitting from bookshelf to bookshelf , Malcolm did n't pay him much attention . It was the end of his shift on a humid Saturday where all he could think about was the summer party happening later that night . And Tessa . Most of the bookstore 's patrons made their way out of the cramped wooden door well before closing time . All except for the mist eyed man . He had been thumbing through books in every section , then shaking his head in disappointment before moving onto another shelf . Malcolm watched him glide through the sci-fi section , onto romance and business books before finally landing in religion and staying there for a while . Malcolm eyes kept straying back to the clock that now read 5:55 pm , and then back to the man who had a stack of books ringing the creaky old wooden chair in the far corner of the shop . He sighed to himself and began re-shelving stray books while throwing glances in the corner occasionally at the quiet old man . Finally , some minutes later , the strange man rose from his place and walked over to the counter . Oddly , he had no books in hand as he shuffled his way up to the counter top . `` Excuse me . '' the man said shaking voice worn down by age and experience `` I hope I 'm not bothering you , good sir . I 'm looking for something that does n't exist . '' Malcolm gave him an incredulous stare . `` You 're uh ... I 'm sorry ? '' `` Yes , '' he beamed back at him `` It does n't exist , well not yet anyway . '' He looked back over his shoulder `` I think one of these books may be able to help me , but I 'm not sure which ? Malcolm checked the clock again . 6:01 pm . `` I 'm sorry sir , but we 're actually closed now . '' He explained `` Maybe you could come back tomorrow ? I 'm sure someone could help you as much as you need then . '' The man heaved a tremendous sigh . `` No ... no it must be today . That 's quite alright then , '' the man turned back toward the door `` perhaps within the next 100 years then . '' `` Wait ! '' Malcolm was n't sure why he was shouting , but the man stood stone still either way . `` Ah , 100 years ? What do you mean ? '' The man turned back , and shuffled his way up to the counter . Leaning forward he drew Malcolm in and whispered `` Yes , once every 100 years something that does n't exist , does . It 's only for the briefest of moments but it will revolutionize the way you see the world . '' Malcolm was intrigued . He thought about checking the clock again , after all the party started at 7 but then , he figured , how long could it take to help an old man find a book ? `` Well , I can make a bit of time I suppose . What kind of book is it ? '' `` Books . '' the old man corrected . He made his way back to the various shelves and began thumbing through the same books again . `` An author has a particular way of writing . A voice , if you will . This very special thing demands that the right voices come together in harmony . '' He pulled an old , worn fantasy book down from the shelf and thumbed through it before handing it back to Malcolm . `` Harmony ? '' he asked , while taking the book from the man 's frail hands . `` Yes , yes harmony . Everything in the world is wrought in harmony and books are no different . Ah ! Here . '' He 'd gathered a collection of books from every genre and indicated for Malcolm to lay them all out . Malcolm obeyed , laying the books side by side while opening each to a different page . `` Yes , here this one should be page 219 . And this , here should be page 15 . '' The misty eyed man pointed to the first book at the beginning of the row . `` And finally , the first page . '' `` What now ? '' Malcolm asked . His mind raced with possibility . `` Now , '' the man said with a surprisingly toothy grin `` Now we read . ''	0.9999909400939941
At age fifteen , Lana thought of herself as old . All the other girls who belonged to Daddy Cash were younger than her . The new girl , Pixie , was only eleven . Lana watched Pixie , standing just a few feet down on the track , and a car stopped in front of her . Pixie ’ s girlish giggle made Lana queasy . She walked further up the strip , adjusting her top slightly so it showed a line of skin above her skirt . She looked back towards Pixie , but she had already gotten into the car and it drove past Lana . She watched them drive and then turn right , toward the closest motel . That left only Lana . The others , Jackie and Vixen , already found their first trick of the night too . Lana fumbled in her clutch and pulled out her Newports . She had quit a few times , but sometimes she didn ’ t even know why . She wouldn ’ t live long enough to get lung cancer , anyway . She lit the cigarette and felt the side of her head where she ’ d gotten eleven stitched the year before . Sometimes the tricks got violent . Sometimes Daddy Cash got violent . Not that she called him daddy , not anymore . She didn ’ t even refer to him as “ boyfriend ” anymore , like the other girls did . Lana thought of him as what he was : a pimp . She knew he was using her , and these other girls . Sometimes she thought she only went back to him because she had nowhere else to go . Lana took another drag of her cigarette . No , she couldn ’ t lie to herself that much . A part of her still loved him . A part of her still believed he loved her too . How many times had she left him ? And no matter what , Cash always welcomed her back . “ This is your home , ” he told her . “ I ’ m your family , kiddo. ” That ’ s family , Lana knew . No one else in her whole life had ever done that to her . Hell , her own mother wouldn ’ t welcome Lana back if Lana was bleeding to death on her front porch . Lana felt guilty for doubting Cash ’ s love for her sometimes . So what if he was a pimp ? So what if he was using her ? Everyone uses everyone . “ Hey , babydoll , ” a man ’ s voice said out of the car that pulled up to her . She leaned over , looking at the man in the car . He looked like a cop . She couldn ’ t pinpoint one specific thing that made her think this , she just felt it in her gut . “ How much ? ” “ How much for what ? ” She said . She stepped away from the car . “ Have a nice night , officer . Nothing ’ s for sale here. ” “ I ’ m not a cop , ” the man said . “ Sure , ” Lana said . “ Have a nice night , then , whoever you are. ” “ I ’ ve got $ 500 , ” the man said , and Lana leaned forward again . He pulled the money out of a pocket in his jacket . “ What do you say ? ” If she brought home $ 500 , she could call it a night . That would make Cash happy . Lately she hadn ’ t been making that much . The night she ’ d come home with only $ 50… well . Lana sighed and threw her cigarette on the ground . She got into the car . _________ An hour later , Lana was being searched at the police station . What a jerk , she thought . She flinched as the officer patted her down . He ’ d arrested her as soon as she stepped out of the car . He ’ d put her in handcuffs and went through her rights . “ You have the right to remain silent… ” She should ’ ve known . $ 500 for one trick ? Since when had that happened to her ? She ’ d never gotten arrested before , and when they handed her the orange jumpsuit that smelled like feet , she wanted to throw up . The officer had made her an offer . A way out of getting arrested . She spit in his face and then he gabbed her and turned her around , slamming her against his car and pressing himself against her . He 'd whispered in her ear . `` I could do what I wanted anyway . Who would they believe ? An officer of the law , or a street trash hooker ? '' And then he 'd tightened her handcuffs even more harshly , and shoved her in the back of the car . _____ She waited four hours before they let her make a phone call . She called the only number she knew by heart . Cash ’ s . “ It ’ s Lana , ” she said into the phone when he answered . “ Cash , I ’ ve been arrested… I don ’ t know what happened . Look , the bail is $ 1000… ” “ Lana , I ca n't , '' Cash said . `` Look , Pixie has n't come back or checked in with me yet either . I 'll see you when you get out . '' “ Cash- “ But he had already hung up the phone . She held the phone tighter , keeping it pressed against her ear , trying to stop shaking . She felt her eyes sting , but she took a deep breath and put the phone back on the receiver . She walked silently back to the chairs in front of the booking desks . An officer shouted at her to go back to the cell . Numbly , she stood up and walked to the back , toward the holding cell . She ignored the other women and huddled in a corner , hugging her knees to her chest . What were other fifteen year old girls doing now ? Going to sleep probably , on a school night . Having finished their homework and brushed their teeth . Put their school books neatly into their backpack . Set their cell phone alarms on in time to eat breakfast with their mom and catch the school bus in the morning . Lana refused to cry in front of these women . She looked around at them , all older than her , all adults . She wondered what had happened in their lives to bring them here . She wondered if she ’ d grow up to be back here again and again . If she lived that long .	0.999958872795105
I know we were stoned out of our minds . But it was fucking real . - '' Shit , really ? '' - '' Yeah man . '' Like ... It begun by a simple `` Hey ! I know this guy '' , you know that feeling , like a deja-vu of faces ? but then it 's always nothing . There 's nothing . Ever . But then it got weird when I asked you your name . You felt offended . And I picked it up immediately . - '' What 's wrong ? '' - '' I did n't like it . '' - '' Oh . Because of the deja vu thing ? '' - '' Yes . Do you know my name ? '' Something happened right . Something was right and it kinda felt wrong that it would feel so right . I felt it . And you felt fear . And you knew I was feeling excitement . For me that was the definite proof . But you played dumb . I forgave you right there , right then . I knew exactly how you felt . You knew I did . You looked away . I did n't even mentioned it . It took a while for me to find what to say . - '' Let 's assume it is true . It 's a fucking thing . You know ? I mean , it 's just way past `` meant to be '' '' . You nodded . Took your time , but you nodded . - '' You have to be my something . '' - '' You mean like you created me ? '' - '' No . '' I said `` Think bigger . Out of life . My friend . '' - '' From another life ? A previous life ? '' - '' Or a bigger one . '' - '' It 's fucking creepy . That 's what it is . '' Why were you denying it ? What for ? Would you have let me go ? Had you felt the same ? Was it all in my head ? It was too real . And right there , right then , it happened again . - '' Chill the fuck out '' . You said . Yes . I remembered everything . I had an idea : - '' What number would he be thinking ? right now ? '' - '' Shit . I do n't know . It was a long time ago ... '' - '' Come on . It 's scary , but come on . We are on to something here . '' - '' I do n't know . I forgot his voice . '' - '' You ca n't have . I have n't . '' - '' From one to ten ? '' I wrote a number on a paper . - '' To ten thousands . Pick . '' I focused real hard on the number . - '' This is n't working , man . Just '' ... I focused harder . I remembered the first thought I had of you . Crystal clear , I remembered . You stared at me . - '' Four thousand , eight hundred and two . '' I showed you the paper , but it was n't necessary . You were shaking your head , you were very , very afraid . In your hands I placed a pen and a paper . - '' You do it . '' - '' It 's bullshit . '' You had always been so hard on yourself . - '' If it is , do it anyways . If it 's nothing , nothing will happen . Please ? '' You begun to think . I looked away . Into my mind . I saw your face . Somewhere , out of thin air , I remembered your face . Like an exact picture of what I was looking at now , but aged 6 . Sometimes 10 , or 12 . I focused . I relaxed . Into the mind of my past self . My mind palace . And someone knocked the door , and I opened it , and there was a box . Inside the box there were some drawings of something I had drawn when I might had been eight , maybe a little bit older , it was like a boy . I found a memory of a couple of poems I had written about you when I was fifteen , and we had already stopped talking . And then a short story I had written in my late teens which had you as a character , when I had actually consciously forgotten all about you . And it was all inside a folder that had been marked with a highlighter : `` Lucas '' . With your name I found your voice . So bright , so clearly . You felt it then . That connection again . You looked at me . You did n't even had to finished writing down the number , I think you even did n't . You did look straight into my eyes . For the first time in years , I saw your smile again , looking at me . I had missed you so much .	0.9999510049819946
High above the Broken Lands , knights of the sky fought their dance of death . Seated in the open cockpit of his Holland & Sons FE-3b *Lancer , * Commander Richard Turpin had a god 's eye view of the air battle . Off towards the western side of the struggle could be seen the fleeing convoy of merchantmen , their coal fed steam engines sending plumes of black smoke high into the sky . A few revenue cutters , taken out of mothball and outfitted with extra armor and guns shepherded their charges like loyal guard dogs , ringing the steamers and their precious cargo . One cutter was already sinking , a deadly black wound in its side . A flight of bombers had skimmed over the water and released their payload of torpedoes . The cutter 's captain , his name unknown to Turpin had ordered his ship between the wake of the torpedoes and his charges . He took one meant for an oil tanker the Duchy could scarce afford to lose . Turpin saluted him for his bravery . Just below him Falcon and Griffon Squadrons were fighting in a massive furball against the convoy 's attackers . The foe 's insignia was unknown to Turpin , depicting a cloaked skeleton holding both scythe and hour-glass . A mercenary unit , same as his . An enemy biplane tried to loop behind Captain Kellerman 's *Sparrowhawk , but the veteran pilot refused it , cutting back on the throttle and shredding excess speed . The biplane fell right under Kellerman 's sights , his three machine guns shredding the heavier machine from nose to tail . First the bullets flashed bright as they hit the engine , then they splashed red from the pilot 's blood . The sound of the lead rounds stitching through taunt canvas was like the roll of a snare drum . Escorted by his pair of wingmates , Turpin 's Command Triple had little to fear at six thousand meters . The air was thin , and even under the thick layers of wool and flying leathers he could feel the icy bite of the wind . There . Flying at perhaps four thousand meters and moving towards the ships , a pair of enemy bombers . Wiggling his wings to attract the attention of his comrades Tuprin pointed towards their prey . Gesturing that they understood , Turpin leaned his stick forwards and to the left , spilling down and towards their target . His altimeter spun down as he hurtled towards the ground , his speedometer ticking steadily upwards . *170 ... 175 ... 180 ... * The lumbering two-seaters never had a chance . One of them , crewed by a more observant rear gunner , opened up , his tracings stitching an orange stream across the sky . None of them flew near Turpin whose ears were deafened by the roar of his engine and whistling wind . The lead bomber fell under his sights . No . Closer . The second gunner opened up , the paths of their bullets crossing one another as they fired up at the descending triple . Turpin 's vision was completely filled with the sight of his target . He saw everything , the lozenge pattern camouflage , the rear gunner with tinted goggles and white scarf trying to reload his weapon , the black cough of their in-line engines ... Now . Turpin 's twin 7.7mm machines answered to his commands , spitting violet tracers and invisible lead down onto his prey . There was no way he could miss , each bullet finding its way towards the enemy plane . The rear gunner 's head vanished in a spray of red mist , his body slumping over his gun . The engine caught fire and began to engulf the cockpit and although he knew it to be impossible , Turpin swore he heard the enemy pilot screaming . And just like that he was past , turning back towards the sky to regain precious altitude . His kill fell in a blazing inferno , a cloud of acrid smoke billowing in its wake . The other bomber tumbled from the sky like a broken bird , its right wing shattered in two . It was Turpin third kill of the day .	0.9999959468841553
The first human contact with aliens was awkward and distressing . Best described as snail-like sentients , the Aluumu were slow-moving pseudo-molluscs who had developed a sort of organic technology that had allowed them to venture into space . They were old - about 10 billion years older than humanity - yet their technology was just barely beyond our own . But the most astonishing fact was that they did n't understand the concept of *weapons* . Human xenobiologists and xenoanthropologists who studied the Aluumu homeworld were stunned to find a culture and ecosystem that *did not have predators* . This sort of biological harmony meant that the species shared genetics freely across various animals and the Aluumu were actually massive colonies of different species - similar to our terrestrial Chondrophores . At the very basic level , everything on the planet Aluu ingested only inorganic or decaying matter , the lowest organisms converting the matter through to the higher organisms in a beautiful chain of complex biochemistry that left many of our xenobiologists irritatingly excitable . The other problem ( for the Aluumu ) was that they had no concept of *selfishness* . Coming from a global system that only *benefited* from total altruism , they did not understand the human capacity for moral ambiguity - and were therefore easily taken advantage of . Lacking any concept of conflict and finding the concept of war terrifyingly incomprehensible , they ignored our differences and tried to 'integrate ' us into their species by altruistically seeding us with genetic information ; to not only bring about biological perfection by freeing us of disease , but to 'soothe the savage beast ' within us and remove our dominant , violent traits . Humanity , of course , saw this as an attack . The Aluumu had been in contact with many other sentient , space-faring species , as we discovered from their records . What remained of the species after the Aluumu 'wars ' amounted to nothing more than a handful of individuals who were kept in research facilities and used for advanced genetic research . From them , humanity learned to program itself into a biologically superior organism . Like the Aluumu , most of the other alien species had no concept of war , or it had died out in their very ancient past . Organic life in the galaxy , it seemed , was far less like us and far more like the snail-creatures we had practically exterminated . Primed by the terror of the Aluumu 'wars ' , where vast portions of humanity had been 'infected ' with a 'zombie virus ' that made us slow-moving , affable and selflessly co-operative to the point of docility , the Earth corporations who controlled our resource-stripped planet saw an opportunity to demonstrate what would become the defining feature of our species - unbridled greed . Behaving like mobile insect colonies , the Idri were the next to fall , then the Palacatalata - city-sized super organisms comprising of billions of trillions of cooperative single-celled entities . Both put up a token resistance , but both fell quickly to the scourge of humanity . Panicking , the galactic community convened and elected the Rovak - the only other race with a vaguely war-like history - to head their battle fleets . But humanity , having taken such pleasure in genetically engineering super-soldiers and reverse-engineering alien biotech , had built massive , unstoppable juggernauts in preparation for what we saw as an 'inevitable ' conflict with another species like ourselves . To say the war was one-sided is being generous . It was a massacre to make previous human genocides feel comforting and benign . Aided by the hideous , arachnid appearance of the Rovak and an 'insurmountable ' language barrier , the human troops thought they were simply making pre-emptive strikes against an aggressor hell-bent on wiping us out . Certainly it looked that way to the average citizen - planet after planet of newly-built alien military outposts , strategically positioned against Earth and its colonies . Fearing an end in the same manner as the Aluumu , the Idri and the Palacatalata , the galactic races surrendered to humanity and begged for their lives . In the aftermath , we sit here , rulers of the galaxy , virtual Terror Gods to these gentle , placid aliens . Aliens who learned the art of war far too late ; just as we learned the art of *peace* far too late . Humanity is treated with such deference and reverence on the alien populated worlds that it is *embarrassing* to step foot on whatever passes for their streets . Even the remnants of the Rovak species grovel , flip themselves on their back and present their furry , vulnerable underbellies to us , showing we are the dominant species . Other races , like the Yu , will simply commit mass ritual suicide on sight of a human being , so we can not even set foot on their worlds . The damage we have done to this galaxy is utterly beyond repair . There is no way back from this ; even should humanity become like the Yu and commit massive , galactic suicide , the other races will never recover what they once had . They are too frail , too fearful and too broken . As we harness the last technologies of the elder races and our collective eye turns outward from the Milky Way , I fear for the rest of the universe . *- Allison Hale , Xenobiologist*	0.9999887943267822
“ Congratualtions ” The wide eyed and eager stewardess greeted us upon arrival . Something about this seemed wrong , even though it was fair . 'You have been selected to save to the world ' , the sign outstretched over the open blast door streamed . “ Honey , grab your sister . Honey , take your ” ... everything seeming so fast , the pushing and shoving of lines , and guards barking orders . Sounds drawn out into a single cacophonous fuzz of confusion . “ Honey , take your sister ” , said mom . “ Do n't get separated no matter what ” , she scolded into us , physically placing my hand upon my sisters wrist . Griping at her wrist as if ready to guide her . It 's time to be the older brother . A deep hue of red filled the room and lite the walls . What was once white light now drowned in a crimson that casts itself across the corridor , as if it was the blood of those left behind . The bright red fading in moments to a black , a darkness broken by emergency lights spinning , and the glow of electronics . “ Mandy , your wrist ” , I spoke out in the dark . The bright glow of my little sisters wristband now showing '20 ' . looking down upon myself . `` My wrist band is changed too '' , showing '19 ' . It was then it became obvious . The meek who bought a ticket inherited all the world , and I assume the pilot and stewardess get a take as well .	0.9999955892562866
It ’ s one of those mindless things you do , you know ? You walk to the same old lady at the canteen , absent-mindedly handing her the exact amount for your standard daily breakfast . You skirt round the same building every morning to get to where you need to be . You grunt in acknowledgement when your wife tells you about her day . We lived in an apartment on the thirty-seventh floor . The air was breezy and the view was great . We had no children , but we were happy just the way it was . Until we weren ’ t . The old lady at the canteen passed away six months ago . When you heard the news from her co-worker , you must have felt something . But you were in a rush and hastily handed your money over , as usual . Different person , same routine . All of a sudden , someone you saw almost daily was no longer there . But she was just a stranger , right ? Life goes on . The building was cordoned off , having been designated for demolition . You realized only then , that it was an old apartment building just like yours . In the days leading up to its end , it became a nest for rats and addicts . Sometimes you would see them in the mornings , too high to leave . The adjacent building was being designated for preservation . Construction was ongoing for a plaque that would declare if the last mayor or the local Olympic medalist had once lived there . As you rode the elevator up , you wondered what this building would be like in a century : celebrated or shunned . Well , you weren ’ t going to be around to find out . She wanted a divorce . The floors slid down and down again in the glass panel . The lift brings you higher and higher still , distant from the bustle of the streets on a Monday morning . That day , you didn ’ t get to see the old lady ’ s younger co-worker . You never even got to find out either of their names . You didn ’ t skirt round the cordon of the old apartment building that had addicts , or check if the actual plaque has finally replaced its temporary wooden counterpart . Today , the floors just kept sliding past . Perhaps you have been attentive for the first time in a long time . Perhaps it was the guilt of so many missed opportunities that were weighing you down so much that the lift was struggling . Perhaps time always stretches when one ’ s life is coming to an end . She had flown away to stay with her parents . That was your last missed opportunity . The floors slid on and on and you had the wild thought that perhaps you were going to crash through the roof . What was it that finally caused things to break down ? Was it miscommunication or the snapping of the final shred of tolerance ? Was it the time when you forgot the anniversary or the time she didn ’ t get a response to “ Do I look fat in this ? ” When was the last time you truly fought for her ? The floors slid on . Something was definitely wrong here . You thought you had given it your all with her , especially in the last couple of weeks . But is there something else to be done ? You repeatedly pressed the “ R ” button impatiently . What was wrong with this lift ? But there *was* something else to be done . You have fought for her , but never totally letting down your guard , never totally putting yourself out there for her to rip to shreds if she so chose . The elevator chimed *ding* . The doors slid open . You look at the LED panel , and realized that it was thirty-seventh floor although you were single-mindedly heading for the roof . You were exactly where you needed to be . You ran out of the longest elevator ride and to your apartment . Your passport was in that drawer in your room , in the home that belonged to both of you .	0.9999958276748657
Spencer Portman pulled out his gun as he entered the door slowly . All the evidence brought him to the factory where he was sure he 'd find his suspect . He did n't know who he was , but he knew what he had done . Death and destruction had been on the rise in the city and it was because of the one known only as *Boom* . Scanning the area inside , Spencer kept his gun trained forward . It was quiet and gloomy- the only light entered from windows high up near the tall ceilings- , but he knew Boom was there . He could *feel* it . Suddenly a small explosion boomed on the other side of the nearly empty room . Spencer looked over , his gun still in hand and began sprinting toward the source . Before he got very far , someone jumped out of the shadows and knocked Spencer to the ground . He lifted his gun to the attacker , but it was kicked out of his hand quickly . Spencer stood up and looked at the attacker directly . `` Boom ? '' he asked . The man smiled without saying a word . `` It 's over , '' said Spencer . `` Lie down on the ground , *now* . '' Boom ran toward Spencer , but he quickly moved out of the way and kicked him in the stomach . Spencer moved in with a fist , but Boom ducked and returned a punch of his own that landed . He reacted with a kick , which knocked Boom backward and followed it up with a punch to the jaw . As he leapt forward for a final blow , Boom rolled to the side and swept his leg under Spencer 's , tripping him to the ground . Spencer pulled himself up , but was met with the butt of his own gun , knocking him back to the floor . Spencer woke up in darkness . A soft orange glow illuminated him , giving minimal light to the area around him . He was chained to a support beam . As much as he tried to struggle against it , the chains would n't even budge . His neck was free , so he looked around to find the source of the light . It was a timer attached to a a strange electronic device , counting down with only ten seconds left . There was a post it note underneath it . > It 's not over yet > -Boom	0.9999438524246216
In the aftermath of the Euchidian Wars , Dresdoks and Prelons alike came together on the fields of Breddain to shake hands and decide on the new order that would tie together not only their peoples but their cultures and their cities so that a Dresdok could go into a Prelon city without fear , and a Prelon could go into a Desdok hovel and know comfort and eat good food , where the children of these diverse people would play with one another in the schoolyards and these people would be as one for all time until the Dragons came and rent it all asunder . Note : This is close to the actual first line from a ... `` novel '' ... a work acquaintance had me read for critique once he discovered that I was a writer .	0.04211442917585373
Hi mom . God , every time I come here I cry , but I 'm only talking to a fucking grave stone . You would probably tell me to 'watch my mouth ' or 'respect the dead . ' I miss you so much . I still hear your voice , you know . The high notes of your yelling when I upset you . The affectionate tone you used when you were proud of me . I hear you more now than when you were alive . And you know what ? I listen to your voice now too . I know I said some unforgivable stuff , but I was just so mad mom . I was angry and full of hatred when you left dad . I wish you had just told me that he cheated on you . But I get it . You did it for me . You stayed with him until I was 16 , and you did it just for *me* . You deserved a happy life . I was such a bitch . I 'm sorry . I never wanted you to leave the house , and I sure as hell never meant it when I said.. when I wished you were dead . It was the worst thing I ever said and I will never forgive myself . But , I did n't think it would be the last thing I ever said to you . `` Are you OK mommy ? '' `` ... Yes sweetheart . Just a moment . She does n't just have your name mom , she looks like you too . She has your beautiful sandy hair and those big brown eyes . I brought you daffodils . I remember you loved them when I was a kid . I hope you still like them as much as you did . I love you mom . ''	0.9999953508377075
The blood on my hands drip on to the white Persian rug my wife had bought 4 years ago.. such a shame to waste such a beautiful rug . Guess I 'll have to replace another . . `` I guess I got ta roll that fat bastard up in it '' I mutter to myself as I clean up the horrific scene . The fire poker , covered in blood with plump red-suited man 's eye still stuck on the end . A gruesome scene none the less , I quickly cleaned it up . I Hid the body behind the bar as my wife happend to be walking down the stairs . `` Honey what are you doing up ? '' She murmurs , she 's been taking alot of sleeping pills lately . Poor thing , bless her soul . I told her to go back to sleep , and she did . I dragged the body and put it in the back of the old pick-up , after that it was a short snowy drive to the lake . I have a warehouse there , it 's a place I could *work* at . I prepared the saws , and tongs . I cut out a decent sized hole in the ice , and pulled the body close so I could tie the anchor to his feet . I toss the anchor in , the sound the chain makes as drags over the ice , into the depths of the waters is chilling to the bone . When the body hits the water i slide the block of ice back into place . The cold preserved the bodies well , I 'd say I 've accumulated about 20 specimen over the span of 4 years .	0.9999955892562866
`` Did n't you have a birthmark on the back of your neck ? '' Amy said as she gently ran her fingers through my hair . `` Huh ? No , I do n't think so . '' Amy stopped her soft petting and stared quizzically at the back of my neck for quite some time before saying `` I 'm pretty sure you did . '' At this point , I was rather baffled . Amy and I have been dating for three years , and suddenly she 's decided to make up some sort of birth mark ? `` Amy , '' I said . `` Would n't I know if I had a birth mark or not ? '' `` Well , yes . I suppose you would . '' `` Then I can guarantee you that I have never had a birth mark . I can also guarantee you that I never will .

'' `` Well , **now** I 'm a little disappointed . Fine . '' I took my shirt off . She snatched it out of my hands and threw it on the floor . I spun around to look at her , but she twisted my body back , making me face the mirrored cabinet again . `` What are you doing ? '' I asked . `` Just hold still , '' she replied . God , I loved her accent . There 's something so elegant about Brits that I ca n't seem to get over . `` Ha ! I knew you had a birth mark ! '' She ran her fingers down my spine and stopped a quarter of the way up my back , slightly off to the right . `` See ? '' she said spinning me around so I could look at my back in the cabinet . She was right , I had a rather large , yet faint , birthmark on my back . `` Okay , so what ? I do n't have one on my neck , I was just confused , '' I replied . `` You said you did n't have a birth mark . You lied . '' `` I told you , I was confused . What does it matter , anyway ? It 's just a birth mark . '' She sat in silence for a few moments before I saw her eyes widen . `` Is something wrong ? '' I asked , growing a little more than a little concerned about the condition of my back . What if , I thought , there is some nasty deformity that I had failed to notice . Or cancer . I 've already had a cancerous mole once , I 'm not looking forward to another . `` No . I do n't know . Maybe . '' She was growing more and more panicked -- it was n't obvious , but I could see it in her eyes . `` Is there any reason , '' she continued , `` that you would have a birth mark that says # 2903 ? '' `` 2903 ? '' Then , it hit me . All of the memories came rushing back -- the cancer , the chemo , the doctor telling me I was definitely not going to make it . And then , the last resort : I could clone myself . I could clone myself and be rid of the cancer -- any illnesses really , but there was one catch ... I 'm the clone , and the real me had to die .	0.0006133532151579857
The writer picked up his old Moleskine journal , it ’ s binding coming undone and the back cover hanging off . He had recently been going through his old stuff from his high school days , looking for things to throw away to make room for new things . He took a deep breath , preparing himself for the worst , sat down at his desk , and opened the journal . Sloppy , smeared handwriting greeted him inside . Line after line of his nearly indecipherable scrawling text . Dialogue , setting , paragraphs . He looked over it with pangs of nostalgia , and just a touch of embarrassment . This was some of his early work . And it was absolutely horrible . But it was his , so he kept it . All these years , in the back of his closet , waiting for him . He flipped through the pages , remembering what it was like to write all this out , sitting on his bed in his old family home . He was so young back then . So naïve . He read through everything he had written , slogged through the awkward love scenes between the main character he based on himself and the female character he based on his then girlfriend . Their messy breakup was one of the main reasons he stopped writing this story . He learned a lesson then . Never base characters completely off of people you know . He got to the end , and being a sentimental sap , wrote a note on the page where he left off . I ’ m sorry to do this to you . I really am . You know how much effort I put into this . You were there , every step of the way . I thought about your story every day , and I was really excited about it . But I had no idea what I was doing back then . I just rushed into this , having no plans about where the plot was going , not even knowing what the plot was in the first place . It was a rookie effort at best . But I ’ ve gotten better . I ’ ve started a new project , one that actually has a plot . It ’ s going to be a long haul , but I think it ’ ll make it big . So thank you , for being my first big failure . Because without you , I never would have gotten to where I am now . -M He put down his pen and smiled . He was closing the book , when something caught his eye on the last page . He opened it back up to reveal that a message was appearing below the one he had just written . A rookie effort ? Your first big failure ? That ’ s all we are to you ? Is that really what you think ? You created us , and now you toss us aside like garbage . You never cared about us . And now you ’ re going to throw us away . -D Startled , the writer sat there for a while , looking at the note that had been written . The handwriting wasn ’ t his , not even close , so it couldn ’ t have been something that he had written and somehow hadn ’ t seen . Besides that , he told himself , this is clearly referencing what I just wrote . He decided to write back , see if there was another response . Maybe his mind was just playing tricks on him . He picked his pen back up and began to write again . I said I was sorry . I am sorry . But I couldn ’ t continue with this story after the breakup , you know that . There was too much in here based on Emily , and after we split , I couldn ’ t bring myself to continue writing about her . -M Well maybe you should 've thought of that before you started writing about us . You took a huge risk , and it did n't pay off , and you just blew us off when it became “ too hard ” for you . You 're selfish . You 're weak . You 're a terrible writer . -D The writer sighed and rubbed his eyes , growing tired of this back and forth with someone who 's stuck in the mindset of a high school freshman . Alright , look . I understand where you 're coming from and what you 're thinking . I created you . And I know you feel abandoned , because you think you 're all alone . You think nbody really understands you . You think you 're the only one who really “ gets it ” . But heads up ; you 're not . There are people out there who could understand you , who could help you , but you do n't reach out to them because you hold your standards too high . And now you 're alone . Not because of me , but because of you . You made yourself alone . And now your time is up . Goodbye . -M The writer signed his initial , closed the journal , and leaned back from his desk . He sat there for a while , staring at the journal . After a while , he stood up , took the journal off of his desk , and walked into his kitchen . He rummaged around in his kitchen drawers until he found what he was looking for ; a book of matches . He took the matches and the journal and walked to his back door . He stepped outside , into the warm summer evening air . The sun was setting , and the wind was still . Perfect night for a little fire , the writer thought to himself . He placed the journal on the ground , and opened it up to a blank page . He struck a match , and dropped it onto the open pages of the journal . It did n't take long for it to ignite , and soon it was burning nicely , the fire crackling and smoking . The writer smiled to himself , and looked into the sunset . He stood there like that until the sun went all the way down below the mountains , and then looked down at what remained of the journal . There was a scorched area of his stone patio , but he did n't mind too much . The journal was a pile of ashes now , smoldering weakly . He stamped them out with his foot , leaving nothing burning The writer thought to himself that it was oddly poetic , what he had done . He ’ d destroyed his work , but at the same time , had destroyed an old part of himself , a part that he wasn ’ t necessarily proud of anymore . He felt rejuvenated , revitalized , like a phoenix who had just been born again from ash . A fitting metaphor , he thought with a smile , as he walked back inside his house . He shut the door , and turned out the patio lights . The pile of ash sat there , until the wind began to pick up . Slowly , the pile began to get smaller , as the ash was carried away into the air . Eventually , as the writer lay asleep in his bed , the last of the ashes disappeared , blown off in the breeze . And in that moment , the writer and Daniel , his creation , both knew peace .	0.9999959468841553

It was a perfect world . Nobody fought wars , it caused the Link too much pain , everyone had food , it weakened the Link otherwise . Humans had evolved , their mental consciousness linked . Thoughts and feelings shared between every human . Everyone had become equal , because it was no longer a fight over single bodies . It was only they . When two people were from the same bloodline , or shared a bond like no other , this was called MentalLink . It made the two people closer than ever , without being able to read thoughts . The Link was essential to every human . It shared knowledge , education , happiness , and death . Even though we could now feel emotion , we often preferred verbal communication . When somebody was born , which was rare , mostly because since the evolution , more humans became sterile , or had more miscarriages . It did n't after much , the human average age was close to 150 . When Jamie gave birth to her boy , Konnyr , son of Dustin , both parents never felt MentalLink . The world was shocked . They should all be able to feel this child , unless it died immediately , which many had assumed . Doctors took it away , assuming it had n't survived the birth , shocked to see him perfectly healthy . They all saw him perfectly healthy . A boy not born into the Link . Doomed to be a Singular . The first one since the Evolution , over 300 years earlier . It never occurred to them that the Human race should be made up of many Singulars . No new ideas to be shared , everyone had a place , everyone was part of the Link . Konnyr was the single symbol for hope that the human race would start over again , better than before . Yet They did n't see it that way . Konnyr grew up , because They could not kill the child , in a compound . A laboratory . His eyes were extraordinary , most eyes then were dull cookouts of what they had been . His were bright green-blue , with brown spots . They wondered what it felt like , to be disconnected from something that was like a simple extension from your body . They wondered , but none ever tried . Konnyr grew up as an attraction . A monkey in a zoo for one pair of eyes , but the whole world to see . He had his own ideals , his own thoughts , his own voice . No matter how much he wanted to use them , he was kept silent , until death . He simply kept alive until he died , and without knowing it , was bringing the human race to better places . *Sidenote* : sorry I wrote this so quickly . I love the idea , and would totally write an actual short story on it .	0.9999741315841675
Come little one , I think it is time to tell you and your brothers a story . A story of the reason we are here . But also a warning , as stories we tell often hold . Before time began there was nothing . With the advent of time , little bits of the ether began to clump together as they never been able to do without time . This led to a great build-up of matter . But this was not any matter such as earth or flesh , neigh . ‘ Twas an ethereal matter that in its nubile form that had never contacted other matter , even of its own kind . This build up soon reached a point where the milk of the universe could not support its own weight . Thus it curdled into a new form . As nature is perfect , and the perfect form is a circle : it formed the Sacred Wheel of Cheese . Aye , a truly beautiful spectacle to behold if there had been eyes to see it with . When the stars were born of the wafting wondrous odor , the world of its flawless rind : all was right . But then from somewhere in the darkness they came . Make of the same blackness that was not shone in the light of the Cheese , crows and ravens . They slashed and hacked at the noble Fromage , only to be rebuffed by the glorious inhabitants of the rind . Their feathers , purified by the Cheese ’ s curds , fell to the rind to make the continents , and their life-sauce made from the colourless and black became the seas and oceans . Yes I know that they ’ re blue… Stop punching your brother… No , I am not making this up… The reason all of the water is blue is because the Cheese had a secret . It formed like a raindrop , a raindrop is not all water . It starts from one of the smallest specks of dust then as water comes to it , it can become larger . So , what was it that the glorious Cheese formed around ? A blue gem . There are no stories of where it came from or if someone put it there , but we know that it was there . When those ravagers saw it , they fell upon it with more gusto than they had to the cheese . This was their undoing , as the stone began to shake and shiver it drew those terrible beasts near to it . Then as a final gift to the world , the stone tore itself to pieces in a flash of energy and light . Those shadow creatures were destroyed along with the gem , spreading its blue essence to our sky and water . The cheese was scattered everywhere , landing on our humble rind , in the grim void . But one large piece stayed with us as a companion . Still if you look up , you can see its battle scars . I have carried this story for many years , children , now I must warn you . Do not believe the vendors when they tell stories of how their suppliers retrieved the cheese from a grand old cow . All cheese is descended from the Cheese , and the supplier hacks away in mines where the cheese came to rest all those aeons ago . So children do you think that we should waste this cheese ? Of course not ! This children is why you are gifted with a half-gram of cheese a week .	0.9999850988388062
`` Ninety seconds to impact , '' I called across the cabin . Hundreds of blinking lights around me coloured my vision green and red and amber . Captain Andersdottir waved her hand slowly , her eyes fixed on Europa in the distance . `` Navigation , '' she called out calmly , running through the final systems check . `` Navigation is go , we are in a stable Jovian orbit and have a clear view of Europa for the duration , '' Lieutenant Tanaka stated flatly . We 'd been in orbit around Jupiter for ten days now with no problems . `` Sciences ? '' `` Analysis software is good-to-go , '' Dr. Hauptman said quietly , staring blankly at her monitors . `` Communications ? '' Andersdottir asked , turning to Lieutenant Gonzales-Smith . `` We 're five-by-five , channel is clear . '' `` Good , '' Andersdottir said as she turned back to face the icy moon . From here it looked about three-quarters the size of a full moon on Earth . We would n't be able to see the impact itself , but the data would arrive almost immediately . `` Telemetry , '' she continued . `` Telemetry is within 0.05 deviation , '' I said , reading the numbers off the tiny screen at my station . `` *Galileo XXV* payload impact in ... thirty seconds . '' We all turned to observe the moon , holding our collective breath as twenty-four satellites on six orbital paths around Europa stood ready . They 'd been collecting data since we 'd arrived , but their true purpose was about to unfold . `` Count from ten , Singh , '' Andersdottir said quietly , hesitant to break the silence . I watched the countdown clock tick down , then ... . `` Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five -- payload will impact the surface in two ... one ... radar confirms payload has reached the target . '' The idea was pretty simple . *Galileo XXV* was essentially a rocket with a 125-foot tungsten rod at the tip . It orbited Europa for six days , making slight adjustments to put it into an orbit with a high-altitude apogee . Today , about three hours ago , *Galileo XXV* reached its apogee , made a sudden adjustment , and began plummeting toward Europa . Seventeen minutes ago the satellite went full blast on its reverse thrusters , releasing the tungsten rod and allowing its inertia ( and Europa 's gravity ) to pull it to the surface . Once the rod hit the icy surface , it was falling at something like 22,300 kilometers per hour ; the force of the impact pushed it through seven kilometers of ice ( the thinnest portion we could realistically hit ) , then it plummeted through about 3 kilometers of water before slowly sinking 99 more kilometers to the bottom of the ocean . The impact was significant , enough so that the other twenty-four satellites could measure the shockwave through the ocean below the ice . If the shockwave hit something more dense than the surrounding water , it 'd slow down ; if it hit something less dense , it 'd speed up . Simple . But there was still 76 minutes before the shockwave completely travelled around Europa , so we sat back and checked all the systems for the hundredth time today . `` Hold on ... yeah , something 's come up already . '' We turned to face Hauptman 's station . It was obvious what she was looking at : an oval patch of extremely dense materials , a bright red shape on a green background . Then two more . Then five or six , all ovular but of different lengths . Suddenly the signal cut out . `` Comms ! '' Andersdottir shouted . Gonzales-Smith rushed back to his station , turning a number of dials and throwing a headset over his ears . `` Captain , there 's some sort of signal stepping all over our broadcast . I 'm reading multiple sources , intermittent . Triangulating now ... . '' We watched as he typed in a command and stared at his screen . `` Ma'am , they 're ... coming from Europa ... . '' `` Multiple sources ? '' Andersdottir asked . `` Can you filter them out ? '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Too strong . They 're overpowering our satellites , and -- hold on -- okay , they 've all stopped , data stream is back online . '' We turned back to Hauptman 's montitor . There was a thick black stripe where the shockwave had been moving during the interruption . Naturally , the data would be stored on the satellites ; it was just a matter of retrieving them later . But to our amazement , there were now hundreds of circles , perfect circles , all congregated in a dozen clusters . `` How big are those ? '' I asked . Hauptman circled one with his finger , then tapped twice on the screen . The computer began measuring the diameters of each circle . `` Program says between 21 and 22 kilometers , average 21.45 kilometers in diameter . Density around 11,000 kilos per cubic meter . That 's as dense as lead , maybe a touch less . '' `` So huge spheres of lead-like materials scattered across Europa 's oceans , '' Andersdottir said to no one in particular . `` Is it possible that it 's a settlement of some type ? Like a European city of sorts ? '' I shrugged my shoulders ; hypotheticals were n't my thing . `` I do n't think so , '' Gonzales-Smith exclaimed after a moment 's thought . `` Those ovals we saw initially : I think those were spheres , too . But as the shockwave approached , they started moving ; the computer registered the movement because it was a pocket of density . It could n't predict movement , right ? '' We all stared at him , wondering if he was correct . If they were moving ... . `` Well , '' Hauptman interjected , `` we 'll see when the shockwave returns . There 's enough power that it 'll reverberate back to the point of origin and still be picked up by the satellites . '' And sure enough , as the second data set began coming in , there were the same hundreds of spheres , all huddled in groups near the north pole of the moon . `` Lots of movement , '' Hauptman said as he pulled up the initial picture . Sure enough , most of the spheres had shifted slightly ; strangely , none had migrated from one group to another . `` Are they ships of some sort ? '' Tanaka asked . `` Maybe submarines ? And are they broadcasting that signal ? '' `` Well , I do n't know about ships , '' Gonzales-Smith replied quietly , `` but I 've been running triangulation , and all the signals come from sphere groups . '' `` Here 's the thing , '' Hauptman said , pointing at the screen . `` They 're all quite dense , perfectly spherical , *ja* ? And they 're also all resting at the bottom of the ocean on the seabed . Obviously . No movement , very uniform sizes , capable of producing signals when affected by the shockwave . '' She stared at us all for a moment , then frowned . `` It 's possible that they 're eggs . '' `` Bullshit ! '' Tanaka shouted . `` There 's no way ! If they 're eggs , what laid them ? Something would 've appeared on the monitors , yeah ? '' `` Most likely , '' I said . `` Unless they 're exactly as dense as the water . '' Hauptman nodded his head . `` These satellites could tell the difference between olive oil and canola oil . '' `` So then they ca n't be eggs , right ? '' `` They could be , '' Andersdottir replied , her voice trembling . `` If the parent was interplantary . '' Tanaka scoffed . `` Now we 're stretching things , '' he said brusquely . `` We collect data , and the eggheads back on Earth do the hypotheticals , right ? '' `` I 'm with Tanaka , '' I said with a sigh . `` It 's a headscratcher , no doubt , but let 's get the data from the satellites and move on to Titan . '' Everyone nodded in agreement . `` Alright , we 're going to begin extraction of the data , then Tanaka 's going to program the satellites ' journey to Titan . T-minus three days until we break orbit , okay ? '' Just then , a number of alarms began blaring at Gonzales-Smith 's station . He threw on a set of headphones and watched his monitor . `` Ma'am , the signal 's back , '' he said breathlessly . `` Pretty strong , too ; it could fry out the satellites ' receivers . '' `` Switch to emergency band , order them to harden for the next six hours . '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Signal 's covering the emergency band ... . '' he turned a few dials . `` I could send it on UHF three ; that 's clear , but the instructions will take about twenty minutes at that low a frequency . '' `` Do it anyways , '' Andersdottir barked . `` And see if you can turn them away from those damned spheres ! '' Gonzales-Smith nodded , then paused for a moment . His face drained , becoming pale and sickly . `` Ma'am , '' he said shakily , his voice trembling with fear , `` the signal 's not coming from Europa . ''	0.9999914169311523
**One** The Orc platoon was moving quickly , spreading out as they staggered behind the knight at closer and closer ranges . The panting knight 's vision remained fixated ahead , inferring the growing danger from their footsteps , twigs snapping underfoot , and the guttural grunts and roars which seemed to almost wet his neck with their slobbering howls . The princess in his arms squealed with terror as one hurled a hand axe which the shinning man ducked under at the last second . `` Enough is enough '' he thought , as they entered a sun-bathed clearing , in a moment he placed the maiden at the foot of a royal oak and spun around to face the beasts . He counted five Orcs and chuckled briefly at the one who he now saw had an arrow comically sticking out of an eye socket . The battle lasted seconds , with a glint of light the knight drew his silver sword and sliced three of the orcs with a seemingly single blow that left their bodies to freeze upright then slide in half lazily revealing the perfect cut made through their waists . `` God I love that . '' He muttered . Then in a second streak , he swung the sword in a twisting arc which took the sword and attached arm of an advancing Orc , finally throwing the blade like a javelin straight through the last green face 's open maw . After retrieving the blade he walked back to the tree where the beautiful woman in silk leapt to her feet . `` My Hero ! You have saved me from the horde , now come ! Live with me as royalty in the castle ! '' Removing his visor the knight looked up to see two flashing prompts above the fair maiden 's face [ Kiss Princess ] | [ Confront ] As the knight cocked his head for the kiss and the screen narrowed to a letterbox Jonathan snapped the gaming device shut , and tossed it on the couch . He already knew what came next , he thought as he stood up , walked to the kitchen , and opened the pantry . He had kissed the princess so he would now have to escort her for a few more levels back to the castle , wherein he would be accepted as royalty but would soon have his morals tested as he learned of the bloody acts the dictatorship took to keep their power . Eventually being forced by the game to kill the mad King . He grabbed a ceramic bowl from the top shelf and a box of 'Krispy Krunch ' from the lowest . It was not despite this plot knowledge that he had kissed the princess but because of it ; for if he had confronted her with his knowledge of the murderous dictatorship he would then have to fight a quicktime-induced battle with her to avoid being stabbed , a fight which could only end in her death and his attacking the castle not from within the royal family but from outside the gates and through the creation of a people 's rebellion . A bit of the cereal missed the bowl and scattered along the counter-top . `` Choice is funny that way '' Jonathan mused as he splashed milk over the pile of yellow flakes , `` Sometimes it 's just a pretty way of getting to the same ending . '' And that was when the doorbell rang .	0.9999955892562866
`` Another drink ? '' I asked , reaching toward the liquor cabinet . Luckily for us it was well stocked . `` Do I ever say no ? '' Eugene laughed , finishing off the one he had in his hand . It 'd been 3 weeks since we got snowed in this place , but it actually was n't bad . Neither Eugene nor myself had any real love for our countries . Sent out to die because some asshole I did n't even vote for ca n't keep his mouth shut . Sure , the first couple nights were tense , but since then we 've treated it as a vacation . Storytelling by the fire , and a lot of booze . I filled the glasses and hobbled on over to him . `` Walking a bit better ? '' Eugene thanked me , grabbed the glass , and took a nice sized drink . `` Yeah , Caroline 's a miracle work ... '' Shit , I 'm an idiot . Luckily for me Eugene just laughed . `` It 's fine , my foot could n't be saved . Besides , it means once we get out of here I get to go home , they 'll probably toss your ass back on the front lines . '' He took another big drink . `` You know it 's funny . We 're a different race , we have different religions , and we come from a world apart , but none of that seems to matter . when we sit down and share a drink . '' I sat next to Eugene . `` Damn right . Do n't care what you look like , who you pray to , or who you follow as long as you can make a good drink ! '' His glass is almost empty now , man this guy can drink . `` Men can be weird like that . Gods ca n't get in the way of a friendship , but a pretty girl can . '' Eugene gave me puzzled look as I slid the knife into his side . `` I know she chose you , but I want her . '' Tears welled up in Eugene 's eyes , but he did n't make a sound as he slumped over . Eugene was a great guy , but not as great as having 2 months alone with Caroline . She 'd learn to love me by then .	0.999994158744812
Everyday I lie awake thinking of a time long past ; hoping my sins are not discovered . My sanity is slowly leaving me . I started to hear noises during the night ; creaks , footsteps , and then a knock . There was no greater fear than to hear the knocking each night . For every day that passed it would get louder , ever so slightly . Hiding under the covers could not remedy the terror I felt . I knew what was in that closet . I knew what knocked on the door . I knew it could not be ignored , but still I went on as if it never happened . Again , each night this knocking became louder , each night I lay in fear , each night I would scream in horror of what was to come . There was no escape . I walked to the door , now shaking violently from the force of the demon behind it . I flung open the door and was met with darkness . There stood a skeleton . Still as a painting , staring straight at me . I stared back , into the black holes where eyes should be , and I saw no more ... I am in darkness . I am lost forever .	0.9999958276748657
Yesterday was a really rough day . My ears are still ringing . I can barely remember much . It 's hot as hell out here and my shirt is drenched in sweat . Maybe I just got ta clear my head with a good , long shower . Grabbing a towel and throwing my soaked t-shirt into the hamper , I headed out to the showers . Ever had that feeling you had everyone looking at you ? I could feel the judgement , but some people felt compelled to make some remarks . `` Holy Shit . '' `` Dude ... '' At that point I ran towards the shower . I did n't want to believe it , but there it was . I was marked . Looking over my shoulders at the mirror I saw not just any name , there were five . The names were blistering from my skin marked in deep blood red . I could barely make out the names cause I 'm not proficient in reading backwards . `` Thomas ! Thomas ! '' My superior yelled out . he must of heard about me being a marked man . `` Sir ... I do n't ... '' `` Save it and come with me now . Throw this on . '' he said as he grabbed a grungy and wrinkled t-shirt from a nearby hamper and tossed it at me . Walking toward his office , all eyes fell on me . Looks like word spreads fast . I could n't even have a thought to myself about how this could 've happened in the time it took to spread . Entering his office , he barked at me to take a seat . `` Alright , take off your shirt . Let 's see what we got here . '' he questioned . Doing as I was told , he forcefully pushed my head forward to see all the marks . Muttering to himself , I could barely make out the words `` mercy '' and `` shit '' . He immediately left , leaving me here possibly as a self reflection . When I joined , they said I was doing my country a service . I was told that what we did was for the greater good and in the service of the people . They said fighting on the front lines for the service was a necessity and not a crime . Yet here I am , a marked man . Marked with five names . Marked with shame . Marked as a murderer . My superior returned to the office shortly followed by his own superior . Again , his superior shoved my head back to observe the marks of shame . `` What the hell have you done soldier ? '' his superior said . `` I do n't know sir . '' I responded meekly . I 'm terrified of what 's gon na happen now . `` Sir , he was working security detail on the supply convoy with me yesterday . We were attacked but we were able to repel the enemy forces . '' My superior spoke on my behalf . `` Let the kid speak for himself , Jacobs . Did you murder these people ? '' his superior yelled out . Deep down , I tried recalling all of the events of the attack . I remember us riding through town . We were joking around in the humvee . We always said the dumbest things to help take the edge off . After all , we 're un-welcomed soldiers in a war torn country . The slow , bumpy ride was soothing , at least for me , because we were moving . No need to rush , and no signs of danger . Going through town , usually the kids and adults would come out to the streets and cheerfully greet us . It was silent and silence is never a good thing on a battlefield . No kids . No adults . Just one yell . `` RPG ! '' Then everything became a blur . I remember jumping out of the humvee and returning fire to protect my friends and fellow soldiers , but that 's about it . I tried to tell my superiors what I remembered but I just could n't remember the rest . `` Jacobs , look at the names . It 's a god damn family . This is a fucking PR nightmare . '' his superior scoffed . `` Jesus Daniel , is that all you care about ? He fought like hell to protect our unit and the convoy . It could 've been collateral . '' my superior barked back . I do n't know what 's worse . The thought of me murdering them in cold blood or that I accidentally did so . I 've killed so many enemies before without a hesitation . What could 've happen to make me a marked man ? `` Collateral or not , a fucking family is dead because of him . The truth does n't matter in the eyes of the people . A marked man is a marked man . He 'll be dishonorably discharged . '' He 's right . I do n't know how or why , but these marks proves I 'm responsible . Regardless of intent . `` This is fucking bullshit Daniel . He saved so many soldiers yesterday . War is war . People will always die , but we fight for the greater good . He protected us . It 's not right for him to be discharged , especially dishonorably . '' he said with absolute vitriol . `` You 'll address me correctly soldier . You can forward those complaints to the Military police . We 're done here . '' his superior said as he threw his weight . `` Yes sir . '' Jacobs said bitterly . As his superior walked out of the office , Jacobs threw his chair across the office . He was livid . Jacobs looked at me , `` I 'm sorry Thomas . You deserve far better than this . '' `` Do I ? '' Baffled , Jacobs questioned me , `` Why would you ever doubt that ? You 're gon na be robbed of your benefits . Your service record . '' `` What defines murder in war , Sir ? I 've killed many in the name of our service and I 've never been marked until now . We were traveling through their home . We 're soldiers in a country that does n't want us here . We were protecting supplies for us , not them . This family is dead because of me . Because I was protecting the convoy . Because it was my duty for the service and greater good . Yet they died because I was doing my job for the `` greater good '' . What good are we doing , Sir ? We 're suppose to have pride in our service . What pride do I have for killing a family for the service ? Collateral or not ? This is my mark to bear . Do I deserve better than this ?

`` Alphanumeric ! '' exclaimed the old man . Tomby was his name , or at least that 's what they called him in the 2124 Euro-African Union succession wars . He recognized the other man instantly , he was the one that got away . Tomby sat down to try take in what was happening . He blacked out for what seemed like a few seconds but turned out to be about four minutes . He rentered consciousness to the sound of of his grandchildren rhythmicly chanting `` grannn ... grannn ... grannn ... '' like they did when he would nap on the shitter . The paintball fight was bout to begin and he found that in his blacked out state he had been outfitted with a tippmann 2098 , painted to look like an Indonesian rebel 's rifle ( which he considered disrespectful due to the ongoing conflict . ) As he walked into the field with his dependents . He then remember that he had seen Galden Hinefar before blacking out . This was the man who he had been assigned to kill , but had managed to escape through careful use of a small broom . Tomby new that he needed to `` finish the fight '' ( he chucked to himself at the halo 2 reference , a game which was now about 120 years old but still fun ) . immediately Tomby walked towards Galden , being pelted by by paintball until people started to get confused abut his seemingly lack of fucks given . Once he reached Galden he pushed the confused old man down and shoved his Tippmann down his throat and started shooting . about 8 small children watched in horror as an old man was murdered in cold blood before them . Once Galden 's body was filled with paint and mostly motionless , Tomby turned the gun on himself and pulled the trigger ; forgetting it was a paintball gun . Failing to kill himself , he sat down in the sand and though about his time as a death squad leader in the euro-African union succession wars , and how much fun he and the boys had .	0.9999927282333374
Alabaster doors , unfathomably tall and unimaginably wide , shifted silently open beneath the gentle brush of Catarin 's fingertips . Glancing once more behind her , she stepped into the Temple of Ages , the stone slabs swinging shut behind her . *The Temple of Ages - an homage to the Old Gods , divine beings that granted Their chosen warriors powers beyond any mere mortal . Countless wars were fought in Their name , and countless people died to sate Their bloodlust . * Catarin could n't help but stare in awe at what stood before her . A grand hall of white marble stretched out before her , seemingly unending . Jewels and gems , silver and gold and platinum lie unmolested in ornate filigree . Crystal chandeliers hang suspended from nothing , flickering light fracturing and scattering into the darkened corners of the corridor . *Surely this hall could n't fit in the Temple , * thought Catarin , *for the plateau upon which it stands is barely large enough to support the Temple itself . This hall should have broken off from the building and fallen into the Abyss . * *None truly knows from whence it came . Some time after the Fall of the Ieryssi Empire , scholars believe , the Old Gods placed the Temple of Ages upon what was then called the Abyssal Spire . A singular column of volcanic rock juts out from the bottomless Abyss , and at its top sits the Temple . * Reminding herself of her purpose here , Catarin strode forth into the impossibly long hall . Beautiful tapestries lined the walls , depicting ancient battles and long-passed conquests . Beneath each saga , the artifact of legend stood , seeming to wait for its next champion . Catarin walked briskly past each weapon , never giving any more than a passing glance . *Excalibur , the legendary sword that Artur used to fell the armies of Myrdr . Mjolnir , the holy warhammer that Thor Odinsson wielded in his conquest of the North . The Horn of Yeshua , which razed the walls of Ierysalm itself long ago . Many have flocked to the Temple of Ages hoping to find their glory . * Catarin stepped lightly , trying her best to not disturb the dead as she moved steadily toward her charge . Bones littered the beautiful marble floor , the bleached skeletons of would-be warriors and desperate fools . Catarin knew better than to reach for one of the Old Gods ' gifts . *Pitiful , * she thought , *thinking Them anything other than fickle . * *There is only one way to reach the Temple of Ages , and that is via the bridge . The Temple stands in the middle of a bottomless chasm , an ancient volcano that has long been dormant . The bridge is no easy task to maneuver , though . It is as old as the Temple itself , and has long been rotted and frayed . * All the weapons were shining examples of ornate design , extravagant beauty and breathless wonder . All but one . Catarin stood before the altar , winded and feeling older than she began . Calloused hands lowered the cloth wraps from her face , and golden locks fell in waves as she gazed toward the image above her . *It is the First , and it will be the Last . You are the only one who can rightfully take it up , Catarin . It 's up to you to save us . * It was a crudely drawn picture . Two figures in shades of sanguine reds and earthen browns , standing in resolution . Two figures , strengthened in their fraternity . Two figures , standing in opposition . One figure , standing above the broken body of his brother . *Only you can save them , * the First whispered to her , *and I can give you the power to do it . * ... Catarin Ierys , Empress of Ruins , stared toward the Temple of Ages with a righteous fury . Its blackened facade seemed to laugh at her from atop the Spire , a cacophony of mockery that crawled beneath her skin . With a disgusted sneer , she took hold of the weapon she had traveled so far to obtain and hacked away at the moorings of the bridge . The sharpened rock sawed through the ropes with minimal effort , and within moments the rickety bridge was falling . She watched with satisfaction as it sank into the darkened depths of the Abyss . And Catarin turned and began the long journey home to kill her sister .	0.9999958276748657
*I 'm Fucked . * I glanced at Alexander , who was laying on the floor , now mumbling something about Cyborgs . `` Hey buddy , I 'll be right back , okay ? I 'm just gon na go in to the other room . '' I said , speaking more to the air , than to the 11 year old laying in the middle of the room . `` WAAAuhhh ? DIIAAuhhh . '' Replied my non-coherent Nephew , as I left the room . *Holy fuck Steven , what have you gotten yourself in to ? * I thought to myself , clasping my face in my hands , my back up against the door I had just stepped through . Alexander is my 11 year old Nephew , and if you ca n't tell by now , something is VERY wrong with him . Alexander is about to start tripping balls . And I do n't mean bouncy balls , I mean straight dry heaving for an hour , light trailing , cold sweating testicles . Alexander has just ingested 2 LSD gummi bears . And not just *any* LSD gummi bears , oh no . Alexander has just ingested the 2 Needlepoint LSD Gummi Bears that I was going to use for my `` Ascension '' at Burning Man later this year , each dropped at 140 micrograms . Think super LSD . That 's how **fucked** I am . *That 's what you get for leaving your door open , Steven . Could n't have just closed it , huh . Now how am I gon na explain to his mom that an 11 year old tripping was nothing more than a ki-* . `` WAHuhahauhTAHAuahaha '' Called Alexander from the other side of the door , releasing the train of thought that , expectedly , had stopped at panic town . Water . That 's what I had left the room for . Water , and then we 'll figure it out from there . It is n't my first time handling a bad tripper , I just need to calm down . I 'm a frequent user of LSD myself , and while I had dealt with people tripping hard enough that you thought they were 11 , this was definetely my first time dealing with an actual 11 year old . *One to cross off the Bucket list of `` Things I never thought I 'd have to deal with '' * I thought to myself . Definetely beats that time I saw two nuns fighting a Rhabbi , that 's for sure . `` UNCLE STEVE , THE WALL IS LOOKING AT ME FUNNY '' Screamed the incapacitated Alexander from the other room . `` I 'm coming Alex , just wait ! '' I yelled , at a near sprint with a full cup of water . I burst through the floor to find a shivering Alexander , sitting up-right , and gazing , in awe , directly at the several `` Trippy '' art posters I had on the wall ( for this exact reason , of course ) . `` Here you go buddy , drink this , and let 's talk '' motioning for Alex to take the cup in my hand . Thankfully , he was n't too far down the rabbit hole , and I would n't have to force feed him water . I 've definetely done that more than once with a Tripee . `` Uncle Steve ... why are all the walls breathing ? '' `` Well , Alexander , you remember when you ate those Gummi Bears out of my mini-fridge ? Well , those were meant for me , because they are dangerous if eaten by an 11 year old ! '' `` AM I GUNNDIE ? ? ? '' Perked up the now frantic child . *Great choice of words , let 's scare the shit out of the 11 year old on acid . * `` No buddy , they 're just ... . special ! They let you see things that are n't actually there , like a TV in your head ! '' I quickly explained . `` It 'll last a few hours , and then you 'll be normal ! '' `` That 's ... super coooooooooooool ! '' he exclaimed `` Why is it dangerouss ? '' `` Well , buddy , sometimes you see scary things , but it 's okay , I 'm here , and I 'll help you out ! Now , why do n't we color and draw , and everything will be just fine ! '' What else could I say ? That that amount of dosage has brought grown men to tears ? My only solice is that LSD tends to show you an unfiltered , uneffected view on reality . While it does induce hallucinations , they are usually very mild , and are similar to a child 's imagination . Most people think you see things that are n't there , but the most you usually walk away with is a different lighting , some trails , and a more open mind . I almost envied him , thinking of all the things I could have learned tripping at his age . And then , it happened . Tears started errupting from the childs face , as he screamed `` NOOOOOOOOOO , DO N'T TOUCH ME ! ! ! '' at a nearby lamp shade , knocking it on to the ground . `` Alexander , it 's fine , you 're just ... just ... . dreaming ! With your eyes open ! Close your eyes , and you 'll feel better ! '' That did n't work . The moment Alexander closed his eyes , he immediatly curled in to a ball , and started yelling `` Make them go away , make the faces go away ! '' . I knew I had to act fast . There 's only one way we 're going to get through this night , and it was if I took him to his room , a safe place . `` Okay buddy , come with me , we 're gon na go to your room , they ca n't get you there ! '' I said , albiet , pleading more than asking . What happened next , I will never forget for the rest of my life . Almost as if someone had yanked a rope attatched to his sternum , Alexander popped up . From the depths of his throat , he released a screech , so inhumane , I harldy believed it came out of him . `` nnnnnnyyYYAAAAAAAAAARGGHHHHHHHHH ! ! ! ! ! ! '' the now airborn kid screamed , as he jumped off of my bed , and straight in to my stomach , knocking me down . Then , he bolted up , and ran immediatelly out the door . And then , silence . Now , I do n't know if you 've ever tripped with an 11 year old before . If you have , I do n't judge , but maybe your situation was similar to mine . Silence is NEVER a good thing with kids , let alone tripping ones . So , as I ran out , I came face to face with what could only be described as horrific . There Alexander was , panting , stark naked in the corner of the living room . How he had managed to get his clothes off before I came in , beats me . But , things were n't getting any better from there . Not only did I have a naked 11 year old psychonaught to deal with , but now I could see his Mom , my sister , pulling up in the driveway . Only one thing came to mind . *I 'm Fucked* .	0.9999921321868896
`` PRAISE BE UNTO THE DARK LORD ! '' I screamed as I sunk my dagger deep into the skull of the last of my sacrifices . I fell to my knees and closed my eyes , waiting to receive the dark powers promised to me . The ritual was perfect , just as the necromancer had described . 4 sacrifices , each innocent and pure , the ritual symbols drawn in red , the dagger polished and sharpened , the candles fresh and trimmed ... . it was all PERFECT this time . `` He must accept me now '' , I thought , `` my life as a paladin is over , I 've committed unspeakable acts . He must see that my sacrifices are sincere . '' But when I opened my eyes , nothing had changed . I sighed in disappointment . Sister Coraline had lied to me - her garden gnomes were n't innocent . But I know the angels on her porch are as pure as the morning sun , and on the next full moon , I 'll have the power promised to me .	0.9999914169311523
Finally we were brought into a surprisingly small square room . While the floor area didn ’ t live up to the hype inspired by our guide , this was more than made up for in height – thin ledges lining the walls were spaced out seemingly eternally above us , each providing access to eight doors . The floor was made of terrazzo , with a simple rectangular platform embedded in the center of the room . I guessed this was for the guide ’ s use in navigating the archives . Against the wall were eight bare platforms aligned with the upper level ’ s doors . One for each of us . Our guide stood in the center and spoke . He was tall and wore a mask and a black robe . The man was rather unremarkable , like the rest of this place ( excluding the eternally high ceiling ) , but he somehow demanded more attention than anyone I had ever met . His dialect was painfully enunciated but his speech was plain , and like everything else he said up to this point , it was repeated in Spanish and two other languages for the four of us who didn ’ t speak English . As instructed , we all moved to stand by our platforms . I was on the side of the entry opposite the side the guide started on . I would be last , but I didn ’ t wait long – the guide spent the next thirty or so minutes giving individual attention to my peers , bequeathing them various items and quietly discussing… whatever . The first lady got an old glass bottle . One man received a ring , and a spear was the one weapon was given out ( loudly identified by the enthusiast among us as Gungnir . He was crushed when his platform revealed a pair of leather shoes ) . It seemed the guide was a bit more excited than usual in his stride over to me . He put his hand on my shoulder as we watched the platform change shape to reveal my gift : a crystal-looking object with five facets on the top and bottom forming pyramidal shapes , connected in the middle to form the rough shape of a pointed AA battery . Throughout the crystal , the interior was a flat gray color . “ This item is one of eight housed on the second floor of the archives . It is the only one that has never been claimed . Some of these items played significant roles in forming the universe you live in today – others were hardly significant , at least in the hands of those that obtained them . Even in those cases , I was still able to discern the true purpose of every item – except this one . I have no idea what this is . Do you ? ” I told him I didn ’ t . Of course , that was a lie . I recognized it immediately , and my heart was pounding . I had seen it in my dreams for years . He knew , but he didn ’ t press me , and soon enough I was out of the archives and back home . I ’ ve taken the past few moments to write this and calm myself before I crush the crystal . I know that when I do the gray will overtake me , and I will die , but the one that stands in my place will control the world .	0.999995231628418
`` Finally decided to take the plunge , huh ? '' Sam spun around and saw a familiar face standing behind him in line . His cheeks flushed with embarrassment . `` Yeah , '' he muttered sheepishly , `` I guess so . '' Dave clapped his friend on the shoulder with a resounding *smack* and beamed down at him . `` Sam , you are totally going to be fine . I promise ! I 've been reincarnated 28 times , and each time was better than the last . '' Sam removed his halo and started polishing it nervously with his wing . `` I know , I know , '' he whispered back . `` It 's just that my previous life was ... well ... let 's just say it was n't the best . '' He extended a wrist so that Dave could see the garish scar tracing across his lower arm . `` Put all that old shit behind you , man . '' Dave shot back . `` So you were abused , so you were poor , so you were alone . So fucking what ? That life was 100 years ago . Everyone here is looking for the same thing : a chance at a *new* one . '' His hands gestured sweepingly at the room around them and the rows upon rows of similarly lost souls waiting in line to get another bite at the apple . `` Plus , believe me when I say that the ladies down there are getting hotter and easier with each passing century . '' Sam smiled . His friend was amazingly animated for a dead guy , with a thick hearty laugh and an unrivaled passion for getting laid . Although Dave was just shy of 3000 years old , he could still pick up a girl less than a hundredth of his age with just a devilish wink and a lewd joke . `` Thanks , Dave . I just hope I have better luck this time . '' Dave 's brow furrowed . Sam could see gears churning deep inside his head . `` Come with me , Sam . '' Dave 's big mitts throttled Sam 's arm as he dragged his friend out of line . `` Hey , man ! I 've been waiting all morning ! '' Sam protested , but Dave ignored this and kept pulling him up toward the front of the line . His eyes scanned the ticket windows before finally locking onto his target . `` Hey there , gorgeous , '' Dave purred at the heavy-set blonde plopped behind a thick layer of plexi and an even thicker layer of makeup . `` Dave ! '' Her chubby face blushed crimson with a chubby smile . `` Who 's your cute friend ? '' `` Annie , meet Sam . Sam , this is Annie . '' Dave pushed his friend up to the counter . `` We 're in need of some *luck* , '' he whispered , stressing the last word . Annie let out a small laugh . `` Well , let me see what I can find for you . '' Her plump fingers banged away at a computer terminal as her eyes scanned down through the results . `` You might be in luck , Dave . I do have a handful of expecting mothers . All chest-sized double-D . Perfect for a baby of your ... *reputation* . '' Sam stared in shock at Dave . `` Double-Ds ? '' `` What ? You might as well have something fun to play with during those early years ! '' Dave retorted with a laugh of his own . Sam shuddered in disgust as he turned back toward Annie . `` I was hoping for maybe a nice , normal family . Decent income and a safe neighborhood . Anything like that ? '' Annie 's eyes continued to scan before finally settling on one entry in particular . `` This one here sounds perfect ! Her bio says that she 's an heiress of a major hotel chain and was the star of a major movie that was seen by millions of people worldwide . I think she would make an ideal mother ! '' `` She might be a little too perfect . '' Sam 's smile faded . `` It sounds like she would be in very high demand . Do you really think you can slot me in ? '' Annie stifled a giggle as she looked up at Dave and Sam . `` Trust me , I think her slot would have no trouble fitting *both* of you . ''	0.9999955892562866
& nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Captain , we 've discovered the discrepancy . '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' On screen , '' eagerly replied Feltch . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Intercepted frequencies were projected onto the fore window , treating the bridge to a view of a domicile very much like the ones the human crew could call home , if only older fashioned . It had a roof , windows , and doors , but it was tethered to wires and sheltered a wheeled vehicle . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Very picturesque , Android 18 . '' remarked the captain , `` But I do n't see anything out of the ordinary . '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' I advise you continue watching , Captain , '' replied the android . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Another car entered the picture , pulling astride the seeming home . From it emerged what also seemed very much like a human male bearing a box . The creature strode up to the door and rang its bell . The door opened and inside was yet another human male . The view switched to that from inside the house , looking towards the open door . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Someone order a pizza ? '' asked the man holding the box . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' A pizza ? '' repeated the captain , incredulous . He turned to his second in command with a look of annoyance in his face . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Please , sir , '' said the android , motioning towards the screen , `` you are about to miss the discrepancy . '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The captain turned his head around just in time to come face-to-face with the two men in each other 's arms , kissing , the foodstuff having completely disappeared . Feltch was transfixed by the graven image . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Android 18 , is it that week on this planet ? '' Clothes flickered past on screen as the human men were quickly exposing themselves in a frenzied state . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Surprisingly no , captain , '' replied the android , `` Carnal reenactments such as you see before you are commonplace on this planet , and are not restricted to a mating cycle . I have calculated that several petacubits of this form of entertainment flows around the planet through its data infrastructure at all hours , non-stop . Traces of it are found in every facet of the planet 's everyday society . '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The captain stoically considered the android 's findings , framed by an undulating mountain of flesh . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' You mean to say— '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' That they do it all the time , sir ? Yes . These are not your people . We are in an alternate universe . '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The captain 's head lowered . He turned back towards his crew , now witnessing a resplendent display of probes disappearing into so many moaning holes . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Poor bastards . ''	0.9999921321868896
`` I love you , '' she said to me in a soft whisper . That was the first of the three lies she would tell me that night . `` ... I promise , '' she added , in an attempt to sound convincing . My gaze had been settled blankly on a dark patch of ceiling . The bedroom was pitch black with the only illumination emanating from the alarm clock . I spun to face away from her , silent , emotions whirling in my head like a tornado of confusion . `` I know , '' I muttered mostly to placate her , but I knew this would not be the end of it . She reached up her hand to place on my arm . The warmth of her touch , previously so comforting , felt tainted . Instinctively I had retreated from this contact , but immediately I knew this was a mistake . She sat up swiftly . `` Is that really still bothering you so much ? '' Her voice was indignant , and her tone quite elevated from the whispers she had been employing prior . `` I told you , I do n't care about what you 've done . You should forgive yourself , too , and quit letting your self-prescribed penance become a burden on those who care for you . '' There was another brief moment of quiet , and she let out a sigh of exasperation . `` I just ... I do n't know what to do . '' That was the second of the three lies . She leaned over me in the blackness of the bed , placing a hand on each side of my silhouette . I could feel her weight shifting around , and when it had stopped , she was whispering once more . `` Wo n't you answer me ? '' I could n't find the words . I knew , deep down , that her desire to stay with me was not her own ; she believed even deep down that it was , but she was not aware enough to understand that obligation is not the foundation of a lasting relationship . We had built our lives around each other for so many years , and out of some desperation I had let my good fortune blind me to what I truly yearned for . Having her around had helped me alleviate my sense of worthlessness , but in recent days I had found that outside affirmation was only a crutch that I could not rely on forever . I had to seek comfort in my own actions , and know that what I was doing was what *I* wanted ; I had followed through with these urges , and some of them had been , as she put it , 'morally questionable . ' When the minutes passed and I had failed to answer her , she climbed out of the bed . I could hear the faint rustling sounds of her getting dressed , but I made no move to stop her . She made her way to the bedroom door , but paused before she could grasp the handle . It was as though leaving now would signify something awful that had been brewing in the back of her mind , like a wild animal she was hiding in the broom closet that would claw and scratch and howl until it could no longer be ignored . She eventually grasped the handle and pulled the door open ever so slightly . With a brief glance and a crack in her voice that sounded as though she was suppressing a sob , I could make out the words `` ... be back shortly . '' The next morning as I gazed in horror at the wreckage that had been her car , mangled and sundered in the accident that had occurred the night before , my brain tore itself apart . All the emotions I had been feeling up to this point were entirely replaced with guilt . The voices of the policemen and paramedics that offered words of consolation and sympathy washed right over me . The din of the scene was distant , and I heard only the echo of her final words clearly in my head . `` Be right back , '' she had said . It was then that I encountered the horrible revelation that those words had been her third , and final , lie .	3.593870860640891e-05
Okay , Look . I 'm not proud of what happened . All I 'm saying is that this DID , in fact happen . So , it was a brisk autumn evening . The sun had just set and the golden leaves of the trees around me were settling down for a good night 's sleep . I do n't know why , but I had decided on that particular evening to go to a park and sit on a bench to think . Eventually , the park 's lamps turned on and I sat there , watching as couples of all kinds walked by . At one point , I remember sighing to myself and relaxing a bit , and then ... well , it was much later in the night . I had fallen asleep . I 'm actually not certain what time it was , but I was certain of one thing : I had to pee . I mean , I had so much urine-pressure built up , I could hardly think straight , let alone walk any distance comfortably . The trouble was that the lamps in the part had turned off and clouds now covered the sky . I had no way to navigate to the nearest bathroom , but I had to try . I drew a mental picture in my mind of where I was before I dozed off and where I needed to go . After I was fairly certain I had every detail in my head , I nodded and rose to my feet . The urine in my intestines sloshed back and forth . I could feel the floodgates about to open , but I had to carry forward ! I took a large step and tried to discern the precise distance I could go before the worst case scenario . No matter how I sliced it , I would not make it in time . So I ran . I ran as fast as I could in the darkness of night to the position the washroom should have been . Like all other faulty plans , this one failed abruptly as I ran into a tree . I fell flat on my back before feeling it . Warm liquid oozing all over my lower half . I did n't make it . For the first time in my adult life , I wet myself . At least there was no one to see , right ? I thought I could even make it home without anyone knowing . Boy was I wrong . I know it sounds weird , but at about midstream , I had the idea of unzipping my fly and peeing away from my person . It made a good amount of sense to me at the time , so I did . The problem was , I had no idea how much urine was still in my system . Some time as I was nearing the end of my urine-fountain , my pee began to glow . All of it began to glow . I mean , there was a little green glowing river starting from me and moving in every direction . In the light of my urine , I noticed that a homeless man was on the other side of the tree . To this day , I could not tell you the emotions painted on his face . Then I hear it , `` Oh ! HAIL NO ! '' What ? `` I see water . I come here , and what do I see ? '' A rather obese woman , about a foot tall then appeared out of nowhere . `` I see a hobo and a boy who peed himself in public . And NO ! It DOES N'T MATTER that it is the middle of the night , boy ! How did you even get yo nasty-ass piss all over the place ? '' To be clear , I thought I was dreaming . `` Look here boy . You are the 'Chosen one ' . I 'm s'posed to grant you a wish , and you 's supposed save people ... and here you are covered in yo own piss ! How 's dat ? '' `` Look . '' I say , `` If you really are going to grant me a wish , then I want a super power . '' `` Good . Here . '' She gave me a little necklace . `` Wear dis . It 'll give you power . '' Then she was gone . I do n't really understand what happened that night or what my new necklace was supposed to do ... but I 'm still peeing , and it still glows . I mean , seriously , where is all this urine coming from ? I am like a spring of urine . On the plus side , I have created a perpetual energy machine by peeing directly into a water wheel . That 's pretty great .	0.9996010661125183
My limbs felt as if they were being forcefully pulled away from my body . I was spinning up , left , down , and around in every direction . I kept my eyelids shut out of fear that if I opened them , my eyeballs would be ripped out of their sockets . The pain abruptly stopped and for a split second I felt nothing before landing hard on my back . A cool breeze washed over me and the warmth of the sun radiated on my face . I heard the sirens of an ambulance wailing somewhere nearby . I opened my eyes to see where I was but my vision was obscured by the bright sunlight . I sat up . As my vision adjusted I was able to make out a sign above me that read Murphtown City Hospital . The hospital building was at least 15 or 20 stories tall , the outside bricks were painted a light shade of red and the entire front of the building was covered with windows . The architecture of this time is very different from what I was used to back home . As I stood up a small torn paper fell out of my jacket pocket . I picked it up and found the words “ Jeremy Walter ” written on it . That was all they could tell me before they sent me whirling through space and time . Find “ Jeremy Walter ” . When I walked into the hospital I spotted a young lady sitting behind a receptionist desk . As I made my way over I tried to think of how I could explain ... everything . I decided I would just tell her the truth . She had to believe me . She just had to . The survival of the entire human race was at stake . The lady at the desk looked up and said “ Hello , my name is Rachel ! Welcome to Murphtown City Hospital ! How may I assist you ? ” as I reached the desk . Well… here goes . “ Hey . Yeah . So um . I am not really sure how to put this so I am just going to lay it down straight. ” I gained more confidence as I spoke . “ I am from the future . A future where humanity is on the brink of total annihilation . The event that will lead to inevitable extinction of humanity occurred on this day and – “ Rachel cut me off . “ Sir , I don ’ t know what game you are trying to play here but this is a hospital . If you can ’ t behave accordingly I am going to have to ask you to leave . Now if you could please move aside so I can help the next person in the line. ” I turned around to see 2 other people waiting behind me . Dammit ! She doesn ’ t believe me . “ Please , just listen to me ! I am not playing any games this is serious ! ” Rachel stood up , “ Sir I am going to have to call security If you refuse to step aside. ” She said frowning . “ Alright , alright . I don ’ t care if you believe my story or not but could you just tell me who Jeremy Walter is ? ” Rachel sighed , ignoring my question she picked up her phone and dialed a few numbers . “ Yes , I need security to come down to the main desk . Mhm . Yes . I have a disruptive man here that is refusing to leave. ” I tried to talk over her “ No you don ’ t understand ! Please just tell me , Jeremy Walter , do you know who he is ? ! ” Rachel put down the phone and said “ Sir , please just wait here . Security will be here soon to escort you out . Thank you. ” Before I could think of what else to say two uniformed men walked up behind me and grabbed both of my arms . I flailed my legs around frantically trying to stop the men from dragging me out of the hospital . “ NO STOP ! PLEASE ! YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME ! ” I kicked and screamed but they would n't stop . As we got closer to the exit I turned my head to see a new born child in a small bassinet bin , on a cart , being pushed into the hospital . Written on the bin was the name “ Jeremy Walter ” in large black letters . “ THERE ! OVER THERE ! THATS HIM ! LET GO OF ME ! ” A sudden pulse of strength erupted from my muscles and I managed to knock over the two security officers that were dragging me . All three of us fell to the ground . I got back up as quickly as I could and bolted toward the baby . Instinct drove me , without thinking I slammed my body hard into the nurse that was pushing the cart . I grabbed hold of the babies cart , pushing it with me as I ran down a hallway and out of sight . I could hear the commotion of the people behind me and the security guards running in after me . I turned left as the hallway turned into a T-intersection and continued running . Another left . Then a right . Then ... A dead end ! No , wait ? There ! A flight of stairs on the right ! There was no way I would be able to push the cart up the stairs so I quickly , but carefully , picked up the child in my arms and started running up the stairs two at a time . Down in the distance I could hear the guards yell `` He ran up the stairs ! '' . What was I doing ? This is a child in my arms that was no more than a few days old . This could n't be a coincidence though . I was sent to this exact time , and landed in this exact place . This had to be him . This must be what I was sent here to do . I was met at the top of the staircase with a closed metal door . I peaked over the edge of the stairwell to see four security guards running up , guns in hand . I opened the door and ran out to find myself on the roof of the hospital . This was it . There 's no where else to go . I ran over to the edge of the roof and tried to look for a way down . I heard a voice call out behind me . `` Put that child down NOW ! '' I turned around to see four guns pointing at me ready to blow my brains out . I took a step back toward the edge . `` DO N'T YOU DARE TAKE ANOTHER STEP . '' Tears were flowing down my face . I needed them to understand . `` Do n't shoot ! Please ! Ca n't you see I am trying to help you . I am trying to save all of you ! This child . Jeremy Walter . He 's the beginning of the end . But it does n't have to be that way ! '' The officers looked very confused , and then regained their composure . One of them fired a warning shot in the air . `` I 'M TRYING TO SAVE YOU ! '' I scream desperately . One of the officers put his gun back in its holster and stepped forward . `` Sir . You are not thinking straight . '' He inched closer and closer as he spoke . `` Look down in your arms . Its just a child . An innocent child . We can help you , if you will just hand me the child . '' More tears welled down my face , a lump filled my throat . `` I 'm sorry . '' I threw the child over the edge of the roof and immediately felt the impact of multiple bullets hitting my chest . I fell to my knees , smiling , knowing I had just saved the entire human race .	0.9999865293502808
What exactly am I trying to do here ? 'Cause I ca n't see it . I should be able to see it if there was anything , I wrote it , but there 's nothing . Is this all there is ? Pages upon pages of blank prose and twice-blank verse . Why the hell did I write this crap ? Writing is supposed to be a mirror we hold up to life , a reflection of self . Why then do I see nothing ? Have I gone blind in the interim ? Have I so fully traveled the subject matter that I find it contemptible , or was there never a subject that mattered in the first place ? I read the first page and I see there is a man , but I do not know him . It is not a matter of forgetting what I wrote ; I know that this man dies much later . I know that he moves between locations in space and time throughout the story , but these places and spaces are neither new or truly unknown to him , as he behaves as if neither is the case . His relationship to that space is thus undefined and meaningless . His passage is almost like a mechanical dictation then , and feels almost like I 'm merely charting the position of a boulder rolling downhill fast . Four hundred a fifty pages of this ! Four hundred and fifty pages of this crap . Y'know , at least a builder has something solid he can look at the end ! A bus driver will have seen more of the world at greater depth than most think to remember , all the more for having traveled the same goddamn path one hundred tedious times . A burger flipper will have a tasty burger that he can eat , smash , or hand to someone else . I could say I have made kindling but the paper these words are on did not come about through my actions and if not for my intervention could have been put to a more productive use , like photocopying an image of someone 's rear . At least then some value . What I have made I can not eat , I can not sleep upon , I can not burn , it will not warm me or do much of anything from now till the instant all copies of it have been destroyed . This entire exercise has been completely self-masturbatory and I wash my hands of all of it . Good night , good bye , and good riddance .	0.9999938011169434
Grundleweed regained a hold of his senses and clamped his jaw shut . He could feel his tongue silently fidgeting , sounding out the *wha ... wha ... whaaat ? * tumbling round and round inside his mind . He turned to Lickspittoon . `` Did you see that ? *Did you see that ? * '' Lickspittoon shook his head and laughed . `` I do n't even know how you just did that . '' He strolled over to the crumpled corpse and kicked it with his foot , then looked over at Grundleweed . `` You killed the Chosen One . '' `` I know . '' `` *You killed the Chosen One* . '' `` Yup . '' `` With a rusty sword . '' `` Damn straight . '' Grundleweed puffed up his barrel chest and thumped it with a scaly fist . `` I AM GRUNDLEWEED , '' he bellowed , a gobbet of spittle spattering the dead hero 's angel-helm . `` FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SECOND MINION OF MISCATHURGEUS THE TITULARLY OMINOUS . ALL SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE ME ! '' `` Haha ! '' Lickspittoon cackled , ears waggling . `` Master will shower us in riches ! '' `` No , '' Grundleweed snorted . `` I shall be the new master . '' Lickspittoon shrugged . `` You can be the new Chosen One . You could rise up and rule this land . '' `` Yess , yesss ! '' Grundleweed nodded enthusiastically . `` All shall call me- '' *WHAM ! * The last thing Grundleweed saw was an eight-foot tall , hulking beef-hock of a man , wielding a knarled club with primal glee . There was a giggle , and then a sickening crunch . The giant walked over to the slumped corpse . `` Gaius ? Krod come in on cue this time ? Gaius ? '' There was no response . Krod sighed , and left the cave .	0.9999669790267944
I 'll be completely honest , I wanted to be a Priest . Ever since the demilich Keanu Reeves was found out - I mean the dude did n't fucking age - and summoned his undead hordes across the Midwestern United States , Priests have been the forefront of the Seventh Undead Campaigns . Every other day news would come in about some Archbishop or Rabbi repelling the undead from the arch of Saint Louis , or how the siege of the great necropolis of Detroit was been amassed . You 'd see Paladins lined up in their riot gear , facing off against the swirling undead fleshy masses in the middle of Missouri . Not that Missouri was known for their intelligence checks anyways ... but Zombie Barbarians and Rangers trained in backwater tactics of Gods , glory , and beer still posed some sorta threat . `` Please read the incantation aloud . '' The instructor had droned to each of us . They had lined my classmates along the firing range of the school . A scanned page from some old dusty text was in our hands . Looked like scribbles and murmings , there was a coffee stain on the original text that had been used . One by one we went . A couple of jocks - prime Barbarian material in their own right - shouted their lines boisterously . The quiet mousy girls whispered theirs . My friend aimed his at teacher 's head and wished . No luck there . And then I went . The page hurt my head to look at . The scribbling swirled on the page . What everyone had said did n't make sense . `` Hots Kesem ? '' The fuck were they talking about ? The world grew dark and cold , and the clouding of my head seemed to swirl around me . It scared me , terrified me . The beating raging of the drums surged in my ears in my brains . Was that everyone else chanting at me ? Just ... .get it out of my head . Get it out of my head . GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD . The darkness swirled at me , and so I attacked the darkness . I screamed and cried , felt my blood surge and coalesce , forming before me . And before I was overtaken , I felt the words - barely a whisper - emanate from somewhere within . `` Magic Missle . '' Shit . EDIT : My phone hates spelling .	0.9999922513961792
Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Let ? He smirked . By let , is is of course meant that Mozzie did n't resist being shoved into the wall . With his hands bound before him and his body bruised and burnt from the torture , let was a very subjective word . So , Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Mozzie let Haddock shove him toward the hole he 'd blown in the back of the citadel . Mozzie even let him slam the butt of his rifle into his kidney when Mozzie did n't move fast enough . Grave robbing was n't really Mozzie 's thing . He liked mysteries and liked being the one to solve them . When Haddock first came to him with the spear haft , the engravings upon it had n't meant much , but when Haddock inferred that that the engravings were part of a map a conquistador had made after leaving El Dorado , Mozzie could n't resist . He 'd scanned it , projected it , stretched it out into two dimensional print outs , tested the metal of the spear head , identified the wood in the haft , compared the inscriptions , and hit up Spain for the opportunity to search for the spear section in their historical records . After all that , his break came from a Redditor who 's father had once worked security for a museum in Chicago . And thanks to that tip , Mozzie was able to locate the rest of the spear and even the helm that completed the map and provided the key . `` Move . '' Haddock snapped , jabbing the barrel of his rifle into the fatty part of Mozzie 's thigh . `` I-I am . '' Mozzie called back . The place is full of spider webs and the damn floor is uneven . `` I . . . said move . '' Haddock growled , jabbing him again . `` Dammit , if I twist my ankle or break my fucking leg , then you 're going to have to carry me through this shitty place to unlock the door . So , let me pick my way on my own and just follow me . I 'm bound and bruised and beaten . What the fuck . Just stop jabbing me . '' Mozzie could n't really see Haddock 's face , but the glass eye in his right socket twinkled with unholy light . Haddock wiped his brow with a handkerchief , grunted , then responded to Mozzie 's reasonable sounding rant by firing a shot into the tunnel floor right between Mozzie 's feet . Mozzie swore and went back to trail blazing the spider infested tunnel . He stopped when the floor of the tunnel spread out and the ceiling raised and the corridor went from a barrel vaulted construct to tall rectangular chamber . Mozzie stopped and shined his light upon the floor . They had glyphs etched into them . `` Move ! '' Haddock called . `` Stop . I think the floor 's booby trapped . '' Mozzie reasoned . Haddock squeezed up beside Mozzie and looked at the floor . `` How ? '' Haddock did n't talk much , but when he did , brevity was solemnly embraced . `` Not sure . I 've researched these types of traps before . Some of the panels are , some of them are thin clay plates . Step on the wrong one , and your foot plunges through and trips what ever trigger lies below it . Haddock glared at him . `` Sorry . I do n't know what traps the triggers will set off . There 's no way of knowing . '' Haddock grunted and slid back into the tunnel . A moment later one of the local thugs he 'd brought was pressed in to the mouth of the tunnel beside me . `` What want , boss ? '' The thug asked . `` Kill snakes . '' Haddock ordered , catching Mozzie 's eye . The thug frowned , but pulled out his machete . He gave the prisoner a quick glance and marched out into the chamber ahead of them . His third step punched through a tile . There was the echoing hiss in the walls , and from above a tiny pebble fell on the henchmen 's head and bounced off . He looked up just in time to catch the three inch spear in the small of his throat . It slammed to a stop about a foot from the floor , impaling the man who hung suspended on the spike . `` Go . '' Haddock ordered . As they moved forward , Haddock would probe the tiles with the end of his rifle . Sometimes the tiles would break away and nothing happened , and sometimes they 'd break away and trip the trigger and let another pole slam down before them . By the time they reached the far side of the corridor , a safe path had been found and marked for their return . Mozzie was made to wait while the rest of the henchmen made their way across . Mozzie filled that time by studying the next corridor . It was taller and narrower , but just as dark and there were glyphs on the walls like those on the floor . The floor in the corridor was tiled much like the chamber had been . The only difference he saw was the glyphs engraved on these floor tiles were all the same and , he recognized them . `` What of these ? '' Haddock asked . `` They warn the proud man to be humble . '' Mozzie replied . `` A psalm perhaps . '' Mozzie noticed the holes near the tiles in the wall and noticed their height from the ground . `` Trap ? '' Haddock probed at one of the tiles , it did nothing . `` Maybe . Perhaps they seek to make us comfortable with the uniform warning on all the tiles . I 'll keep watch on the floor to see if any of them change . You do the same with the tiles on the wall . If you see a change in any of the glyphs let me know . Haddock 's reply was another grunt and a prod from the rifle barrel . Mozzie moved forward , cringing in fear that his play would be discovered , but Haddock came in proud like his henchmen and kept his one good eye on the tiles on the wall . Half way down the corridor , a tile tilts under Mozzie 's foot and the sound of a click was the only warning before the spikes slammed out from the sides of the tunnel all at heart and head 's height . Haddock weakly struggled as he was pierced from both sides . The many of the henchmen cried out , but some did n't . One of them in the back had stooped down just a moment before the blades slid out and in his panic to escape the trap , he stumbled back into the chamber and promptly stepped through a clay tile and was impaled as the first henchman had been . Mozzie leaned against the tunnel wall and wept for what he 'd done . He suspected what the nature of the trap would be . All he had to say was for them to keep low and they would all make it through safely . He 'd seen Haddock kill men before , and despite his callous disregard for life , he 'd always made it quick and painless . Mozzie was a scholar . He was the adventuring kind . He was n't fighter . He was n't a soldier . He 'd never killed before , and if he had , he would have chosen to make it quick and painless . The men were still struggling on the ends of the barbs and Haddock 's one good eyes slowly swiveled down like a damning accusation and came to rest on him . `` You killed Maria . '' Mozzie said by way of explanation . The light in Haddock 's eyes seemed to fade and Mozzie knew he had finally succumb . He looked back at the chamber with the two impaled henchmen and the way out and into the dark ahead . He rose and began stripping the dead men of their gear . He used a confiscated machete to cut his bonds , then with a deep breath and an explosive sigh of surrender , Mozzie moved forward into the dark . Hacking at spider webs with the machete , and clutching a stolen Luger in his other hand to shoot snakes and other animals with . He never wanted to be a tomb raider , but now that he found himself at the precipice of becoming one , he could n't find the moral strength to leave . He wiped at his brow with the back of his hand and smiled and that was how Mozzie entered the business . He pushed forward wondering if Mozzie Merchant would make a good tomb raiding moniker . He hoped so because that was his name and he had no plans to change it . `` I should buy a hat . '' He mumbled as the darkness swallowed him up .	6.6287764639128e-05
`` So ... what happens when they 're , you know ... done ? '' I asked Pa , as we headed out to the slave house . `` We put em ' down , of course . You should know that by now . '' I expected he would say something like that , but that 's not the answer I wanted . Today , he was going to tell me why , whether he liked it or not . `` well yeah ... but do n't you think that seems kind of wrong ? It 's not like they really did anything to deserve it . '' I said , trying to force an actual answer out of him . `` What do you want me to say ? They are n't exactly the sharpest tools in the shed , why do you care ? It 's not like anyone else does . '' Said Pa , getting a bit annoyed with the question . As we approached the slave house , movement could be heard . It was quiet , and not a word was said , but the uneasy shifting of those inside was more than audible . `` Let 's get this over with . Grab the old one and take her out back , I 'll go fetch the shotgun . '' Pa said , as he unlocked the chain across the huge double doors . A few minutes passed before Pa showed up with his gun . Becca , as I had taken to calling her , did n't struggle , though I do n't think she really knew what was going on . I was more nervous than she was , this just did n't feel right . As Pa chambered his Remington 870 , I could n't help but speak up in protest . `` Wait ! '' I yelled . Pa lowered his gun , clearly annoyed by the interruption . `` Why does she have to die ? ! Why ca n't we just set her free and let her live the rest of her life as she pleases ? '' `` You know we ca n't do that . Besides , what we she even do ? This old crow would n't make it a week without us . '' `` How can you know that ? ! You 've never let one free before ! '' `` Well shit , if you 're so convinced why do n't you just fucking ask her ? Go ahead , see if she has any glorious plans for the future . '' I looked over at Becca , she had n't said a single word . Pa had apparently trained her well . Still , I had to try . I *had* to get an answer . Surely , there was something she wanted do , at the very least there was no way she wanted to die . `` Come on , Becca . Would n't you rather go free ? You could do whatever you wanted , whenever you wanted . Would n't you like that ? '' I asked , in the softest voice I could , so as not to startle her . `` moo . '' BLAM ! ! ! Well , at least we 'll have good steak for awhile .	0.9999312162399292
`` Get up ! '' A voice thundered in the cryogenic chamber . The steel vent opened and the chilling gas that was shrouding me for god-knows-how-long was being sucked out from the chamber of mine . I rolled my eyes upward . Nov. 03016. , the green neon light flickered . I gazed at the numbers once more : 3,016 . Three thousand and sixteen , huh . You could say I 've been waiting to hear that words for eight hundred years . Did humanity really took eight hundred years to find cure for nano-machine viral infection ? I pondered . I guess the nanos were pushing the boundary of the laws of physics , but I did not expect to take it so long . Also , I thought to myself , these future employee of Cryo Corp. could learn to be a bit more polite . `` I said get up ! '' a voice thundered once more . He sure was impatient . Or was it the case that the culture of future is being rude to your patrons ? I shook the frost chips off my body and began to breath manually . I squeezed my lungs to get the last puff of cryogenic gas out from my system . Although I was a bit saddened at the thought that my family would be long gone by now , but I was prepared . In fact , the anticipation of experiencing the future was racing my heart . `` Fuckin ' get up ! '' A voice rang . A wooden stock of rifle shattered the glass of the cryogenic chamber and hit my stomach . The shards of glasses made several cuts on my arms . I groaned in pain as I vainly attempted to cover up the wounds . A big gloved hand reached me and grabbed me by the collar . The hand pulled me out of the cryogenic chamber and threw me on the dusty ground of the cryogenic chamber room . Dusty ? I ran my bleeding finger against the tile of the room . Dirt and dust and some sort of insect shells all over the floor . `` I will say this for the last damn time . Get . Up . '' said the man of the hand . He had a rifle resting on his shoulder and a thick black gas mask on his face . I reluctantly got up to my feet . I started to cough up the last bit of the cryogenic gas as I patiently waited for what was up . The man was humming to himself and reading through my patient profiles . I was going to ask what happened with the Cryo Corp. but was too intimidated to ask . Even if the future is paradise and all , I doubted he broke through the chamber glass with a good intention . `` Ah , yes , yes ... These ... match up ! '' the man mumbled to himself . He tucked the profile papers under his arm pit and pointed the rifle toward me . `` Now walk , meat bag . '' I raised my hand up and started to walk toward wherever he was pointing . The cryogenic room was in shambles . More than half the chambers were broken and looted , and fluorescent light of the ceiling of the room was out . It seemed like all the cryogenic chambers were running on the emergency batteries as I was told several centuries ago . Outside , about two dozen men in black uniform trench coats and same kind of gas masks on their face awaited both of us . `` Boss ! '' said the man with the rifle behind me , `` We 've got a match ! '' The two dozen men started to separate into two groups and revealed a man sitting on a chair behind them . He alone was donned in red . As he raised himself up from the chair , the men in black knelt before him . The man in red , who seemed to be the leader of the group , opened his arm in welcome and said : `` Ah , my liver . '' His liver . The men in red also stepped away from the hallway and led me to a room . An operating room . In the room , stood a 9-feet hunched giant covered in white rags holding a tray of surgical knives . He was spraying some liquid on them . In the corner of the room , a pile of corpses turned inside out laid dead . I recognized few of them . They all had the same nano-machine viral infection like I did . I saw where this was going . `` Liver ? '' asked the giant . `` Liver . '' answered the man in red . My ear was ringing and my tongue tasted bitter . I woke up , just to die .	0.9999955892562866
The rumble of thunder and flash of lightning lost its awe long ago , Tazbin thought as he waited patiently for the show to end , thinking through his next actions . Start strong , he told himself , go for the- `` What makes you think it 'll work this time ? '' God interrupted his thoughts , nose behind a newspaper . Tazbin frowned at the seated man . `` Defeating an entire squadron of 50- '' `` 47 , '' Tazbin said . `` - with just a spear ? It wo n't work . '' God finished , lowering the paper . `` I know their moves , for the most part . '' Tazbin said . `` The squad leader always starts with an order to flank , sending three men to the left and three to the right . The first in line at the right lunges low while- '' `` Yet , 366 times , you 've died . '' God said . `` Change the strategy , you fool . '' `` You 're the God that- '' `` For the last time , '' He interrupted yet again , `` I 'm no God . Just a man . '' Tazbin smiled . `` Of course . Anyway , you 're the *man* sending me directly in front of the squad , not even giving me a chance to hide from their sight . '' `` You know their formation , you know it fights poorly against those that run . '' `` Retreat ? '' Tazbin asked , face stoic amid the flashes of lighting . `` You think the only son of Zandus would *retreat* ? '' `` The only reason Azmir went to war with the Nozgathians is because a squad of theirs killed you , an Azmir Prince . '' God lifted the paper again , covering his face . `` Suck up your pride and run home to your father , tell him you got lost in the woods , and the world will be at peace . Relatively ... '' Tazbin blinked . `` I 'm no coward . '' `` A leader does what 's best for his people , not himself . '' Tazbin took a deep breath in and shook his head . `` I killed 12 last time . '' God lowered the paper once more and stared at Tazbin . `` Very well . '' The Prince said , still unsure of what to do . `` Send me back . ''	0.9999959468841553
I found this very interesting as I had a very strange encounter with the lottery . @ Thenre , I am assuming you are talking about powerball ? When you posted those numbers , you never had a powerball number . So I checked the powerball history combining those 6 numbers the 4 different ways , and they never did all come up . However , using 5 as the powerball 4 numbers did come up about a month ago . Also , interestingly , at least 3 of these numbers come up with some frequency . About 9 years ago I was onto the lottery numbers , but I did not have them quite right . Then about a month later all the lottery numbers that had hit on May 26 , 2005 came up on the back of my ticket numbers . None of the tickets were worth anything , and sadly one of them with the winning 33 at the end of the ticket number , which had been the winning number on May 26 , 2005 was kept by the retailer . Then the lottery machine reset the ticket numbers and by coincidence I ended up with another lottery ticket with the same exact ticket number with the 33 at the end that I had lost ! I have a photo copy of this . After that , things got strange with the lottery . Numbers were posted at the store for the next week , yet they had not been drawn yet . I asked about this , but the lady working at the store said it must be some kind of mistake . So I got the bright idea to play these numbers , but it was a bad idea . I filled out the ticket , and on the way to the store a truck exactly like mine swerved into my lane and almost hit me head on . I almost turned around , but I thought they are only numbers . When I submitted my card , the lady at the store asked me if I was sure I wanted to play those numbers . Strange , that had never been asked before . The machine took a real long time to print out the numbers . As I was handed the ticket I looked behind me . The girl behind me was wearing a shirt with a broken heart on it . It said `` you broke it , now you have to fix it '' . I thought it must be some weird coincidence . Btw , those numbers did not come up . That night I watched Constantine at my ex wifes house , they just happened to be watching it . It was like Hell was coming out of the TV . I am normally a normal guy , but my ex and her friends could tell I was losing it . I went home , and noticed the state flag at the firehouse was inverted . Instead of a blue background and yellow seal , it had a yellow background , and blue seal . It was like I was in an alternate universe . As it got light I took my truck and went into the mountains to get away from it all . I walked up an old logging road . There were flowers that were beautiful when I walked by , but when I would turn around there would be silk worms all over them , Weird , they were not there when I walked by . It was August , and very hot . I met a couple walking down the road . Strange , no one usually hiked this road . Strangely , when they talked to me they seemed confused , and did not know what day it was . I could not find the trail to the creek , so I finally got so thirsty , and was not thinking right . I left my pants and coat at a specific forest service marking because I was so hot , walked down to the creek down a very steep bank in my shorts and t shirt , drank a bunch of water , and hiked down a very treacherous creek . I finally found the trail and hiked out to my truck and drove home . I had my wallet in my pants . Things were still askew in my mind when I hiked back up to get my pants and wallet two days later . Very strangely , my pants were not at the forest sevice marked coordinate where I put them , but on the next coordinate up ! It was like reality had changed slightly from the way it had been . Not only that , they were tearing that road up for no apparent reason . I had to go around a guy on the ungated road digging part of the road out with a backhoe . I had never seen him before , even though this was a very small town . He had his shirt off and had strange tattoos running down his back . He also had very odd pale blue eyes that were very blue . I could n't help but ask , and he said they were contacts he wore for the chicks . It was sunny out , and I never saw contacts . This was not the type of guy that looked like he would be operating a backhoe for the Forest Service . They tore the whole gated logging road and the road I drove up over the next few days , and replaced all culverts , even though it did not need to be done , almost like they were fixing whatever glitch I had caused . I told some friends what had happened and drove them up that road . They did not know what to think , but did not discount m story . I was well liked and respected around there . There were some other things that happened , but I will not get into it all . Like right when this was happening I tried to call my Mother , but there were no outgoing calls from my town long distance . Eventually , every thing returned to normal .

I know the rules . They are simple . One minute . I do not know why , but I am certain of the parameters of the game I am playing . I used to be in the army , and I consciously decided that if it were needed I would take the life of another man without hesitation . For the sake of those to whom I am a benefit there are many men I would not hesitate to kill . Unfortunately it does not matter . Within one minute 's travel of me I know of no one who I could accept as a sacrifice for my own life , let alone anyone I could actually kill in that time . So that 's it then . I expect my time is already running low . I dial 911 . It should not fall to my relatives to find the body .	0.9999955892562866
As humans , we believed we were independent . That we controlled the course of our own lives . So when the overlords we did n't know we had came to collect us , we felt defiant . And scared . Everything we thought we knew about the universe was wrong . Our far fetched theories of how we were made were cast aside . Instead of the Big Bang , we had been told we were only lab specimens . *Seeded* were the exact words they used . This statement only pushed our thoughts of defiance and independence to knew levels . In fact , we were blinded with rage . We threw everything we had at them . Maybe that 's what led to our downfall . Our militaries were swatted aside like flies . Wreckage rained from the skies . Our petty war lasted a day . Earth weeped for the loss of the its rights . We were prepared to be enslaved , or even annihilated as a whole . Instead , after losing our war , we were cast into a new war . We had to fight for the aliens that had conquered us . The overlords told us that we either fight , or our children would be burned . We either fight , or our home planet would be mined until it was a carcass of its former self . So we did the only thing we could . We fought . The have sent us away with their technology to fight a war that was meaningless to us . We fought a war knowing that *we* were meaningless . Well , that changes now . It 's been five hundred years since our enslavement . In five hundred years we have learned to come together . *We* have learned how to use their technology . *We* have begun to make pacts with other enslaved aliens . *We* have regained the will to fight . And not their war . *Our* war . And as I send this message , we are already preparing the engines , prepping the guns . We are already changing the course of our ships toward the Empire . So let the date not be five hundred years since enslavement . Let today be the first day humans have learned how to choose their path in life . Let today be the day the revolution began ! ***************** I hope you like the story ! I do n't usually do writing prompts often , so go easy on me .	0.9999958276748657
`` Well you 've certainly picked up your cooking game since I saw you last , '' John said , gesturing with his cutlery , `` This roast beef is absolutely incredible ! '' `` Well actually this whole meal is thanks to my better half , '' replied Susan , `` He 's one hell of a chef . '' `` Oh stop it , dear . My head is big enough . '' said Scott . `` No it 's true ! '' insisted Susan , `` Scotty does almost all the cooking around here . It 's like having a personal chef ! '' `` Well ... we know how busy you are , that 's all . '' said Scott , blushing slightly . `` Well I think that 's sweet . '' chimed in Jennifer , `` Every woman likes man who can cook ! '' `` Well I make up for it in other ways ! '' John said , grinning over his wine glass , `` If you know what I mean . '' `` I 'm sure we do . '' said Scott , `` I 'll bet you 're all over those dishes after you get fed . '' `` Not if I know him ! '' exclaimed Susan , `` Neither one of us could ever keep that sink empty . It 's one of the few things we agreed on . '' `` Here here ! '' said John , raising his glass and promptly draining it . `` So tell me Susan , '' said Jennifer , hurriedly changing the subject , `` Are you still working at that law firm downtown ? '' `` Hardly ! '' exclaimed Susan , `` I have n't been at that dump in 5 years ! '' `` Susan is a bit of a free spirit ... '' Scott put in , `` She 's likely to get involved in different fields . '' `` I would n't say 'likes to ' ! '' Susan scoffed , `` I just ca n't stand working for idiots ! '' `` How many jobs have you had , Sus ? '' Asked John , ignoring Jennifer 's hushing sounds . `` Since we broke up ? Christ , has to be 6 or 7 . Definitely over the one-a-year mark , '' Susan replied , topping up her glass . `` What about you John , what are you up to these days ? '' interjected Scott . `` Who , me ? '' John laughed , `` I 'm living free is what I 'm doing . '' `` John is between jobs at the moment , '' Jennifer said quickly , `` But he has some big investments lined up .

'' interrupted Susan , `` Is gon na save the world all by himself ! '' `` It sounds very noble . '' said Jennifer , quietly . `` Yeah we all need to hug more trees ! '' said John with a hearty laugh . `` Can I get you anything else this evening ? '' Asked the waitress , `` Coffee , tea , dessert ? '' `` I 'd love a coffee , '' said Scott , `` it will make the drive a lot nicer . '' `` Same goes for me ! '' said Jennifer . `` I do n't want to sit around while you two leisurely sip . '' said Susan , `` Let 's hit the road . There 's coffee at home . '' `` Yeah we do n't have all night , '' added John . `` Another time I guess , '' said Scott with a sad smile . `` Alright then , here 's your bill . Thank you so much ! '' The waitress said as she dropped the wallet . `` Allow me , '' said Scott , reaching for his pocket . `` Very gracious of you ! '' said John , tipping his glass . `` We 'll split it , of course ! '' put in Jennifer , hurriedly opening her clutch . `` It 's quite alright , '' said Scott , dropping his card on the tray , `` But thank you . '' `` No , thank you ! '' said John , `` It was n't half bad ! '' `` The service was horrendous though , '' sneered Susan , `` Do n't give that waitress a dime . The only time she came by was to ogle . Tips are To Insure Promptness after all ! '' `` Dear ... '' started Scott with an exasperated look on his face . `` Why do n't you let me tip ? '' offered Jennifer , `` its the least I can do for the lovely meal . '' `` Perfect ! '' said John , `` Now let 's hit the road baby girl , you know how you get when we 're out late . '' `` When YOU are out late . '' Jennifer returned , but took the bill and returned it with the tip , `` Thank you very much for dinner Scott . I hope we can do it again some time . '' `` Easy you two ! '' said Susan with a grin , `` I 'm the jealous type . Good night you two ! '' `` Good night John . Good night ... Jenn . '' `` Good night Scott . '' ... `` Sir ? Sir ! '' `` Yes ? '' `` Glad I caught you ! '' said the waitress `` You left your credit card and receipt ! '' `` Thanks so much ! God . I 'd forget my head if I did n't have it roughly screwed on ! '' Scott laughed , accepting the card and paper , `` Thanks for a wonderful evening . '' `` Boy was that lucky ! '' said Scott , settling into the drivers seat , `` I 'd have regret that tomorrow . '' `` Yeh ... '' said Susan , before quickly falling back asleep . `` Huh . What 's this ? '' Scott muttered to himself , flipping over the receipt and a huge grin spread over his face : `` Coffee ? 555-1234 -Jenn ''	0.9999765157699585

“ I love you , ” Al , a usually serious detective , says . “ I know , you ’ ve told me enough times , ” his wife , Sara , replies , who he often calls by the affectionate term ‘ sweetie ’ for no reason other than the generic way he was raised into a world full of sugar . “ Yes , but all the jokes you make , they ’ re just so funny every time , you kill me , you really do , ” he says , he ’ s buckling over , trying to compose himself , recovering from a joke his wife just told . “ Not yet I don ’ t , ” She says as if there is no joke , Al is too busy to pick up on such nonsense . “ See , there you go again , always with the quick comebacks , you know , I wish there was someone like you on the force , you ’ d lighten the mood what with all the serial killings going on of late , all in this area too , I hope you changed the locks on the windows like I said , the old ones just weren ’ t doing us any favours , ” “ I changed the window locks and sharpened the knives ; you don ’ t have to worry , ” she replies , walking over to the window and drawing the blind up that she ’ d just put down just to prove to him that they had been changed . “ There you go again , I almost can ’ t breathe , I ’ m so glad I found someone who can make me laugh as much as you do , ” “ Yes , you suffocating , it ’ s perfect , ” “ I love your sarcasm as well , you know , Joe wishes his wife made as many jokes as this , ” “ Yes , jokes , ” Again , he doesn ’ t see it and continues to chuckle . “ Oh , by the way honey , I ’ m going to invite Joe and his wife round for dinner , can you cook them a steak or something ? ” “ I had the knives sharpened , steak should be easy , I ’ d love to see them again , it feels so long since they popped round , ” “ It is , and Joe says he noticed it too , so that ’ s why I invited him , ” “ Joe ’ s wife , how many children have they had together ? ” “ You know their kids , Sally and Jim , right as rain those two are , ” “ Oh , I remember , how could I forget , it ’ s not enough though , they should have a third , they make great parents , ” Sara replied , pulling the covers up over her and turning her head until it rests easy on the pillow . “ They sure do , hey speaking of which , I know you always wanted three children and our two are growing up so much now that you hardly see them anymore , but you ’ ve forgiven me for having the operation , haven ’ t you ? ” “ How many times do I have to tell you yes ? I ’ d have preferred if you ’ d have told me when you first decided because then I ’ d have been able to tell you that I wanted three kids , but I ’ m over it now , my impulse has gone now , it ’ s managed , there ’ d be too much of a gap between the ages , ” “ Yes , I ’ m so sorry , ” “ Stop being sorry about it , it was a year ago today since you told me , ” “ I know , ” he didn ’ t but also didn ’ t think to question it . *** At some time in the middle of the night , Al is woken by almost silent movement .

Oh , I wrote something like this the other day . I love dragons ! : D Tears streaked from the corners of Edmund ’ s eyes , the beating of Raven ’ s gargantuan wings along with her rapid descent created so much wind that he could hardly take in a breath . His legs held fast to her scaled neck , his lithe body pressed close . Horns sharp enough to impale a man protruding from the back of her skull served as his hand holds as they banked . The tips of Raven ’ s claws skimmed the water before she reared up , throwing her hind legs forward into a jolting landing onto the beach . Edmund clambered down onto the sand and sprawled out , enjoying the sun-heated earth and the rays beating down on him . Raven was in a similar state . He had to chuckle at how similar they had become . He wondered who she would choose to fly with her when he was dead and gone , and felt a sudden pang of sharp jealousy . Would they call her Raven ? He thought back on the day he first saw her , flying high above the pastures he grew up on , circling in search of a fat calf or a grazing buck . He had thought she was an enormous black bird . Lower and lower she flew , Edmund frozen in fear as what he thought was a raven grew in size before his eyes into an enormous reptile , tar black scales each catching the sunlight , gleaming . She landed before him , snatching up a lamb into her jaws and engulfing it . She was regal , and terrifying . Her knowing eyes bored into him , considering . Edmund stood stock-still for what seemed an era , awaiting those jaws to crunch his bones . Who would harvest the grain this year ? Who would cut the wood for winter ? A thousand such trifles cascaded through his mind as he awaited death . The dragon took one step forward , then another . Edmund felt his soul exposed , a level of nudity he had never experienced . At last she stood before him , her reptilian stench filling all his senses , and she lowered her head . Fear coursed through Edmund ’ s body as his hand moved on its own accord , gliding over the intricate scaling on her brow . He felt more than heard her words . *Mine . *	0.9999959468841553
The sun was blazing high above Grand Teton National Park and the forest ranger wiped his forehead before taking a drink from his water bottle . He sighed deeply frustrated by the chaos he and his department was being put through . “ Captain , have you found anything in your sector ? ” the radio buzzed . “ Nothing interesting in my area ” Captain Dereks responded back into the mic . In the distance , he could see the helicopter surveying the other side of the lake trying to figure out where the next body could be . The past couple days had been absolute hell for him and everyone in the forestry department . Search and rescues were nothing new to him or his team but this one was different because they had the FBI on the asses while being kept completely in the dark . In the past few months it was discovered that the oil paintings done by famed TV Bob Ross were real locations but bodies were being found too . Three bodies later and no one could ever say this was just a coincidence but it was rumored that every single body found was charred and had looked like a Hiroshima bombing victim . A serial killer arsonist with a flair for the arts sounded too bizarre to be true but the government mandated lock down was no joke . Thankfully the arsonist kept his flames under control without setting the forest ablaze but burning bodies in the open wilderness didn ’ t make any sense at all to him . Dereks stopped once again to stare at the tall trees around him trying to make sense of the whole operation . Maddox Silvens was their designated babysitter from the FBI taking over his park and that was the only clear thing he got from Silvens because any other information about the operation was too high above his paygrade . It was unsettling to him that he couldn ’ t get any more information about why his park was next but at least the media wasn ’ t here to bother him or his department . He knew it was only a matter of time before the chaos of the media would arrive when words gets out that federal agents are focusing on his park . Every single park in the country was closed and from talking with other park rangers his seemed to be the one getting most of the unwanted government attention . “ Amanda , any update on what we ’ re looking for ? ” he spoke into his walkie talkie . “ Were just about done going through all of Bob Ross ’ paintings and we have narrowed it down to about 30 paintings from the show that could look like our park , ” replied Amanda . “ Should we start looking at other works outside of the show ? ” Dereks thought for a moment “ No Amanda , were already searching this blindly for a possible needle in a haystack . I ’ m going to start heading back soon and we can over what you and Jason have narrowed it down to. ” Just then the park ranger spotted something just beyond the trees moving . He raced over cautiously hoping not to run into something dangerous . In the clearing there was a barely clothed man groaning and trying in vain to get himself up . “ SIR ARE OKAY ? ! ” he yelled out running towards the helpless man . “ My name is Park Ranger Dereks and I am here to help . How long have you been lost in the forest ? ” Derreks examined the man but he didn ’ t appear to be hurt , just week from exhaustion . There were no active orders for a missing person but judging by his raggedy condition it looked like he had been out here for a while . He moved the long hair out of the mans face but he couldn ’ t understand what he was trying to say . “ Sir save your energy , help is on the way. ” Reaching into his bag he grabbed a flare gun and shot it into the air . “ Amanda , Ive found an exhausted hiker and I need a medical airlift. ” “ Roger that Sir . Medic has spotted your flare and help is on the way ” responded Amanda “ Run ” the lost hiker weezed in his feeble state . “ I cant do that sir , help will be here any moment ” the deep look of concern on the man ’ s face puzzled Dereks . He also couldn ’ t help but think the face looked familiar , was he a local , a frequent guest… . Dereks stared a little more “ YOU ’ RE BOB R -- - “ but before he could finish the man he was holding became extremely hot and burned his hands . “ Run ! ” the mysterious man said one last time but it was too late . The incoming helicopter saw the bright flash of light from above and stayed hovering in place . Silvens and his partner were up the hill and not far behind and saw it happen . “ FUCK ! I thought we had more time ! ” Silvens threw his radio against the tree out of frustration while his partner got closer and looked down at the two newly charred bodies . “ Sir , we should have had two more days ! I don ’ t know where we went wrong ” “ I don ’ t care just fix it ! We can ’ t afford to lose another so tell the nerds back at HQ to get their shit straight or I will personally shove my foot up their collective asses ! Now lets move onto the next one before this tracts any unwarranted attention. ” The helicopter had landed safely nearby and Silven had picked up his smashed radio before heading back into the chopper with his partner . Back at camp Amanda looked at the entrance to the park and saw a group of vans approaching the gate . “ Im sorry guys but were closed right now ” Amanda had yelled at the group of white vans . They didn ’ t listen and the vans parked in their position . A man in a suit emerged from the leading vehicle and approached her . “ Ma ’ am Im Agent Stottles with the Department of Homeland Security . I need to speak with you Director so we can begin our work here ” “ I ’ m sorry sir but My director is busy tending to a lost hiker he found but I can direct you to the FBI agent that has taken over before you got here. ” “ FBI ? ” Stottles looked confused to Amanda and she saw the other vans turn around and peel off . The driver of his van poked his head out and yelled “ Sir ! We need to go , the target is on the move ” Without so much as saying another word he ran back to the van and they drove off . Amanda ran back to her radio to get ahold of her Director “ Sir , what is your location ? I need to talk to you when you ’ re back on camp. ”	0.9999908208847046
`` Yeah I know you can read minds , '' the voice scowled . *What ? * I thought . `` Sitting there cocky and all . Thoughts are meant to be private , you know ? That 's why they 're called *thoughts* , '' the voice enunciated the last word . It was a feminine voice for sure . The park was crowded . Much too crowded to identify the one girl talking back . Thinking back ? I lowered my noise-cancelling headphones and listened for anyone actually talking to me . Nothing . Just kids laughing and parents yelling after them . I re-raised the headphones back into place . The headphones were n't necessary for me to read minds , but it allowed me to distinguish them easier . No external noise penetrated them . It gave me tight control of my ability . I gave a final visual scan of my surroundings . No one stuck out . Hmm , interesting . Ever since I was little I thought I was unique . I knew I was unique in reading minds , absolutely . From finding out where my parents hid my presents to getting answers from professors I was always a step ahead of the curve . Most of the time thoughts were so boring , though . Everybody was the same . Insecurities , ideas of what to eat , and money - I 'd heard it all - hundreds of times over . Just across the pasture a cute girl gazed in my direction . She smiled . *Ooh* . I had to see what that meant . I 'turned ' on my ability . `` Oh my god . He 's so cute ! Those headphones are too big for his head - what a dork . But SO cute ... Now he 's looking at me . What do I do ? '' *She 's really into me , * I thought . I smiled at her . She smiled back . I gathered my things and made my way over to her . `` Here he comes . He 's actually coming over to talk to me ! '' *Wow ! I am nailing this . * `` How 's my hair look ? '' She adjusted her hair nervously . *I love when girls do that . * `` Oh my gosh . He smiled again . So cocky ! I loved that . '' I had approached her . She was sitting . Her back resting on the tree . I extended out my hand . `` Hi . My names -- , '' * -- Jonah , * Her thought cut me off , but her voice sounded different . It was that same feminine voice as before . `` You ? '' I asked , confused on so many levels . *Yep ! * She answered . `` You can read minds too ? '' *Yes . Ever since I was young . * I was amazed . `` What am I thinking right now ? '' I was so excited to be read . She inspected my thoughts . I could feel it . It felt as though someone was bumping around in my head . Like when you 're pushing through a stationary bar crowd trying to get a drink . She was looking for something deeper . It took her longer than my surface thoughts would 've taken . Then my head got lighter . She was out . She was laughing . *Legally Blonde ? * `` What ? '' *Your favorite movie is Legally Blonde ? * She laughed again . There was no denying it . How could I ? She 's a freaking mind reader . `` Yeah , I guess . '' I was n't proud of the fact , but it was true . Reese Witherspoon is a delight . `` Wait a minute ! '' I exclaimed . Just now noticing something . *What ? * She asked . `` We 're standing right next to each other . Why are you still speaking through my mind ? '' She said nothing . Just gave a blank stare up at me . I tried her mind . ... Emptiness . She was blocking me . `` What ? '' I asked . `` Why are you still speaking through my mind ? '' *I 'm mute . I ca n't talk . I mean I ca n't physically talk . * I did n't know what to say . *You do n't have to say anything . Believe me - I 'm used to it . When I was young I was a chatterbox . Very outgoing . I loved people and they loved me . * I was staring down at her . She was staring up at me . No words were passing . People walking by us would be curious to say the least . *Yeah , I agree , * she continued . *Anyway , my chatterboxiness got my friend into trouble one day . BIG trouble . I let something slip that I should n't have and I -- * Her thoughts were stifled . She was internally crying . A tear rolled down her cheek . *I , uh , I never saw her again . Ever since that day I gave up speaking . I ca n't remember the last time I spoke . I honestly do n't know if I could at this point . * `` I 'm sorry to hear that , '' I did n't know her name . *Helen . * `` Helen . Let me get that for you , '' I wiped the tear off her cheek . *Thanks . * She laughed again . `` What 's so funny ? '' *I realized how much of a chatterbox I just was . I 'm not even talking and I 'm rambling . * I laughed . *What can I say ? I am the queen ! * `` Queen Helen . '' *I like the sound of that . * `` So , Queen Helen , I would be honored if you would join me in finishing my walk in the park . '' She stood up and took my hand in hers . *So corny . But I loved it . *	0.9999957084655762
SLAM ! Some guy drops into the backseat “ FOLLOW THAT- ” and I ’ m off . It ’ s a black sedan . It ’ s always the black sedan . I am so fed up with this shit . I finally land a job that should be decent , should even be a little fun , but no . I have to deal , almost exclusively , with these wackjobs . “ Okay , What the everloving shit is it this time ? ” I asked , as the little mazda ’ s four cylinders strained to keep me above 80 ( in a 40 mph zone , mind you ) which was , impossibly , mostly free of traffic . Why can ’ t the streets ever be this clear in this city when I ’ m NOT dealing with some wacko trying to save the free world or catch his wife or whatever ? “ Russian nukes again ? That was fun . Someone shot out my windshield on that one. ” I grit my teeth , as I pull into a handbrake turn “ Somebody kidnap your kid ? ” The man in the back ’ s face was a mask of determination , eyes locked on the car in front of us . “ Concentrate on driving . We can ’ t afford to loose him , Not again. ” That ’ s it . The breaks squealed as my car skidded to a halt in the middle of a overpass . That snapped the twat out of his thousand yard stare . “ NO ! You can ’ t stop ! If he gets away again , there ’ s no telling how may people might die ! ” For anybody else , that ’ d be a worthy argument . However , I lived through the aforementioned Russian nuke fiasco mentioned above . So relative to World War III , I think this guy could afford to chill for a bit . “ Not going anywhere , pal ” I said , rolling down the window . And there ’ s the gun . In my face . Again . “ I was trying to be nice , but to be perfectly honest , you don ’ t really have a choice . Drive. ” Unfortunately for his ass , that only works the first two times . “ Actually , mister double-oh-I-don ’ t-give-a-shit , I do. ” I stated calmly , staring him down . “ See , right now , the doors are locked , and the keys are hanging off the side of this overpass by a string . Shoot me , and I let go of it . And you ’ re trapped in a locked cab with a dead body , while whoever the hell we ’ re following goes wherever he wants . Seem fun ? ” His face shifted slightly , eyes narrowing . “ So , why are you doing this ? Who are you working for ? ” His tone , was perfectly calm . Like he was asking about the weather . The dissonance would send shivers down my spine , if I wasn ’ t so suicidally mad at all of reality at the moment . “ I work for Edwards Taxi . AND NOBODY ELSE , OKAY ! ” my voice naturally rose into a shout . “ I JUST WANT TO MAKE A DECENT LIVING , BUT NO ! EVERY SINGLE DAY I HAVE TO DEAL WITH MOTHERFUCKERS LIKE YOU. ” He blinked . “ Like me ? ” “ YEAH , JUST LIKE YOU ! Mob men , people running from mob men , assassins , targets , spies of EVERY POSSIBLE NATIONALITY , and that one archaeologist TWAT who always has people shooting at him ! ” a tear rolled down my face . I hadn ’ t realized how much this had gotten to me . “ So , this sort of thing ” he gestured vaguely to himself and his immediate surroundings “ happens a lot ? ” He said , is tone going from dangerously lethal to comforting in nothing flat . “ LITERALLY… EVERY DAY. ” Normally , these guys are impossible to read , but that clearly surprised him . He sighed . “ Okay , I really don ’ t have time to hear the whole story , but it sounds like you ’ re not running a taxi cab service. ” “ OH MY GOD I ’ M NOT WORKING FOR THE ILLUMINATI OR WHOEVER- ” “ LET me finish. ” he snapped . I promptly complied . “ You ’ re not running a taxi cab service , you ’ re running a high-value asset pursuit service . That somehow manages to work on demand . There are people who would pay literally hundreds of millions of dollars for something like that , and call it a bargain. ” I almost choked on my own tongue . “ Mi-Millions ? H-hundreds ? ! ” “ Yup . You can ’ t exactly charge faire that high though . Most of us don ’ t carry that much cash , and if we are , it ’ s because we REALLY need to , and you ca n't have any . But favors ? If you deal with my sort of profession as often as you make it sound like you do , you could get some damn near incredible benefits. ” “ Wow . Just… Okay , maybe you ’ re right . I can turn this crappy job around. ” I mumbled . Then a idea occurred to me . “ But , if I ’ m going to do that , I can ’ t exactly make do with this piece of junk car ” I said , a massive , titanic , shit-eatingly huge grin spreading across my face . “ I need an upgrade . Something fast . And bulletproof . Something that will actually be good at these chases I find myself in the midst of. ” My still mysterious passenger facepalmed , and mumbled something about how he should have seen this coming , and about wasting a favor . “ Okay , fine . Just drive ” -- -- The man smashed through the window , a hail of bullets whizzing through where he had stood just a moment ago . Expertly tumbling , he rolled to his feet . He had escaped , but The Doktor had MAC-G8F1N ! He needed to catch up , and fast . Just then , a low , yellow sportscar drifted up to the curb , smoke hissing from tires on red , gleaming hubs , the streetlights glinting off a well-waxed exterior , and a unmistakable taxi checker running down the side . The door popped open , and the driver , a young man , probably Pakistani , shouted at him . “ Get in ! Get in you undoubtedly glorious bastard , and let ’ s hunt down some poor sonovabitch ! ” “ FOLLOW THAT CAR ! ” the man shouted . “ Follow him ! ? Imma pass the sonovabitch ! Or maybe get real close , and find out if any of these switches activates a flamethrower ! BEST JOB EVER ! ” his new driver shouted over the roar of the car ’ s mighty engine as they careened off into the night . First story post . How 'd I do ?	0.9999605417251587
TITLE : THE MONEY MACHINE - Please give me feedback ! - Everyday , I could see it getting weaker and weaker . It 's processes lagged . It 's monitor was dim . I dusted its buttons off every single day , but a few hours later , it would just come back , as if I had never even been there . I knew it was inevitable-The ATM was dying . `` Fear not , my son . '' ATM said . `` We knew this day was coming , ever since you were a boy . Now here is your final payment . '' The ATM spat out $ 70,000 as its screen slowly faded to black . I could n't suppress the tears rolling down my face . I looked up to face the decrepit ATM . I had never known my parents . I 've been living on the streets for as long as I can remember . When I was seven years old , I joined a local gang . They always asked me to steal from local stores because I had skinny and fast . No one suspected the baby faced seven year old , which made stealing very easy . I had a family , food , and no cares in the world . At the time , it was a good life . I thought I could do this for the rest of my life , what a foolish thought that was . One day I stepped into a grocery store name Paldi 's with an empty stomach and bad judgement . As soon , as I walked in , I was greeted by employee . `` Why , hello there , little boy ! How can I- '' She froze as soon as I made eye contact with her . She said nothing more and quickly walked away . Even as a 7 year old , I should 've noticed how odd that was . But all I know was that I was hungry and the gang was hungry . My gang was full of teenage thugs , pimps and drug dealers . They were very cruel people , but they were always nice to me because I brought them food . I shuddered to think what would happen if I did n't deliver . I was collecting my usual round of Oreos , bread rolls , apples and candy when I saw a group of employees walking following me slowly . Again , this should of tipped me off , but when you ca n't think straight when you 're hungry sometimes . I was close to the exit , completely ignoring the manager and the employees getting angrier and angrier as if their presence should have been enough to make me reconsider my actions-which it should have been . I was pushing the shopping cart out of the door to the boys outside , waiting to collect every morsel of food in that cart . `` Alright , shorty ! '' A large boy called James said happily . `` We 're gon na eat good tonight . '' Another boy called Tom yelled . Suddenly , the boys widened their eyes at something behind me , and ran . A large , hairy hand grabbed my shoulder and lifted me up and turned me around . I was face to face with an angry , tomato faced bald man . `` YOU ZHINK YOU CAN STEAL FROM MOI '' The bald man thundered in a heavy French accent . I almost peed my pants , I had n't noticed the rusty pipe in his left hand . The female employee from before approached me . `` You think you could get away this for long ? '' She sneered . `` My sister warned me about you . '' The man drew his left hand back , winding up the pipe in his wrist . `` TAKE ZHIS ! '' The manager brought his left hand down with such strength , the air seemed to shift . I seriously doubted I would survive a blow like , so I screamed so loud the large man dropped his pipe . I took advantage of that-poking his eyes with my fingers . `` AHHH ! SACRE BLEU '' His hands instinctively rushed to his face , dropping me . I ran as fast as my little legs would carry me that day , but I soon realized that I was n't as fast as I thought I was . The manager quickly recovered and brought his entire gang of employees after me . And they were getting very close . `` I 'm only seven , do n't these dummy whores have anything better to do ? '' I muttered to myself . Yes , I know does n't make sense . My vocabulary at that time consisted of what I learned from middle school dropouts . Anyways , I only managed to stay about four feet ahead of them . I was running out of energy , so I ran into a dark alleyway , hoping that it led to somewhere . It did n't . It was a dead end , and I was completely exhausted . I had decided to except my fate when I heard a clicking noise . I snapped my head in the direction of the noise and say a bright scarlet ATM machine . I had a logo that I did n't recognize , so I went a little closer . As I was walking , something crumpled under my feet . A hundred dollar bill ! `` I 'm sure he went down this way ! '' I heard a female voice say . I dropped the bill and hid next to the ATM . On my way , there were at least 20 more hundred dollar bills on the floor . `` WHERE ARE YOU '' The manager and his gang had reached the end of alley , but I was hidden by the darkness . The manager suddenly looked down and screamed with delight . His employees did the same . Everyone shrieked with delight and started grabbing as much as they can , but the manager yelled at them . `` ARRETES . Give me za money . It will go to za store . '' The manager commanded . All the employees groaned and gave him all the money they collected . The manager grunted in satisfaction , and they all left . I sighed with relief , and I heard a deep voice behind me . `` I saved your life . You are indebted to me . '' I whirled around and saw the ATM 's screen flash to a bright white . The ATM was the one talking to me . `` I will give you money . Money will get you power in this world . Do you want money ? '' I nodded vigorously , too stunned to speak . `` You must never go back to that horrid band of miscreants you were with before , do you understand ? '' The ATM said sharply . I nodded again . I was n't too fund of them after James and Tom had ditched me . `` In ten years , I will die . '' The ATM continued . `` At that time , you will be 17 years old , and a billionaire , if you follow all of my instructions . '' `` Well , what are they ? '' `` I will start you out with 7,000 '' the ATM spat out a plethora of hundred dollar bills . `` Buy an apartment near here . That is your first task . After you do that , you will be receiving $ 70,000 from me every week as payment for your tasks . '' `` Alright . '' I began picking up the money . The ATM made a coughing sound . `` Those boys , '' he started . `` They will come after you and try to harm you . '' Use the rest of the money to buy a submachine gun . A man sells them in this alleyway on Thursday nights-come exactly at 8 or do n't come at all . '' I looked at the ATM in bewilderment . I was only seven , but i knew what he was implying . `` What ? ! ? ! '' I cried . `` I do n't like it either , '' The ATM said calmly . `` But I heard them was they ran past you . They WILL hurt you if they see you again . '' I dropped the money I was carrying and backed away . `` How do I know I can trust you ? '' `` You have no family and no friends . Do you really have many options ? '' The ATM retorted . I knew he was right . I sighed and began picking up the money . '' `` Do n't worry , '' The ATM said . `` This is only a one time thing . But you MUST stay alive for us to complete the mission , and they are a threat to your safety . Do you trust me , will you join me ? '' I stood up , and nodded at the ATM . `` Excellent . '' The ATM purred .	0.9999945163726807
So there 's this cafe I go to on my days off . It 's rough as a night auditor , y'know ? I stay up all night and watch people stumble up to their hotel rooms . I see the happy drunks , the sad drunks , the prostitutes . I talk to the crotchety old men with too much money , the new bride who is crying because her husband slept with the maid of honor . I smile and wave and laugh at the regulars , the men and women I see week in and week out . We 're both here for work , we all know our place . I have my rehearsed lines : `` Welcome to my hotel ! We 're so happy to have you . Are you part of our loyalty program ? You have a good rest ! '' I say them with a smile that does n't reach my eyes now , I 've been doing this so long . Their replies get shorter as the days go by . Hell , they get shorter as the hours go by . `` I just want to go to my room and sleep . '' Pah . My boss would fire me if I did n't pester you with all these questions , do you actually think I care ? Then come the nude men and women who stumble into the lobby because their loves threw the clothes they were wearing out the window and shoved them out the door . They hide their genitalia with yesterday 's newspaper and beg me to assure them that I 've seen worse . I have , because just last week I had to clean up the shit and piss that streaked our lobby floor from an addict who overdosed . I 've called the cops ten times in the past two weeks . I almost lost my job over five dollars in a drawer that some dumbass kid claimed to have given me , but because his daddy pays big money I could have lost my job by refusing to return the fiver . I 'm only halfway through my shift , y'know ? We only have one camera , and I have two globes sitting on my chest . I 've been cornered in the kitchen more times than I can count , by drunk men that ca n't see past my chub and brown , or who think that they 're entitled to me because I work at an establishment they 're paying to pass out in . When you see the lowest of the low , night after night . It starts to fuck with you . It starts to fuck with *me* , and I do n't care . My coffee is getting cold , and I 'm ready to go home .	0.9999353885650635
My Dearest Shirley , Hey sweetie . I know it 's been a while since the last letter but tomorrow I drop so I figured there would n't be a better time . This place is so different from home you would n't believe it . It makes me ache for the rows of corn back in Iowa , you know , the kind we ran through when we were just kids ? I miss you , sweetie . More than you could possibly imagine . But I 'll be home before you know it . Say hi to Elise for me , unless it ends up being Junior . I love you honey , and Shirley . I discovered this letter crumpled up in man 's pocket , and wished to send it on . Letter was addressed to you so I assume you are wife . I am sorry to say that husband was killed by landmine . Please accept humble apologies and condolences . War is not who we are , I hope you have heart to forgive what we do in the name of our country , and pray that you should not have cause to defend yours . With Regret , Na Chong-hun --	0.9999955892562866
A day 's worth of procrastinating and dreaming left me regretfully unsatisfied . Why did I continue to do avoid my priorities if I felt so bad about not doing them ? Would n't my life be more achieving if I just did what I told myself I was going to do ? Easier said then done I suppose . A knock came from the other side of my door while I was reciting my typical Thursday night of doing nothing more than playing video games and being lazy . The brief sound made me jump from my seat . I was n't used to getting any visitors at anytime , let alone this time of the night . Convinced my mind was just playing tricks on me I switched my attention back to my TV . Another knock , another sudden turn of my head towards the entrance . This time it was real . I trembled to my feet and cautiously walked towards the door . All sorts of possibilities of what will happen next racing through my head . `` Who 's ... who 's there ? '' my eerie voice gave away my vulnerability . `` You . '' A familiar voice answered immediately . My body and mind paused . `` Who ? '' `` It 's you . '' The voice was calm and confident in contrast to mine . `` I 'm sorry , I do n't know anybody named You . '' Why did I say that . `` My name is Harrison Baldt Jorgerforsson . My mother died when I was five and I was raised by my father and his multiple girlfriends in San Francisco . I like football and basketball and played it until my senior year of highschool . I enjoy reading , bicycling and absolutely love movies . '' How could this be ? Was I being confronted by my own impostor ? Surely some prank was being pulled on me by some lonely no life college kids . Everything he said was about me was true . `` What was the name of my second grade teacher ? '' I responded , secretly intrigued by the game the man was playing with me . `` Miss . Harden . '' He answered in a heartbeat . `` Okay ... .good research you did there . Who was my first kiss ? '' I had him tricked now . The only person in the whole world who knew who my first kiss was is the girl herself . `` Emily Dober , sixth grade , behind the bleachers . '' He was right . My jaw dropped as had no idea how to go forth with this situation . We shared a brief moment of silence before curiosity got the best me . In a cautious tone I opened the door only to see my eyes staring right back at me . I was staring a reflection , a perfect resembling duplicate of myself . As if I was staring at a mirror . He was smiling at me like he knew exactly what my face would look like when I saw him . We maintained eye contact with each other for a long and awkward time and shared the silence of the night outside . `` Hello Harry . '' The man said . I was convinced what I was seeing was not real . That this surreal and enigmatic moment was not happening . My eyes were questioning all of the logical knowledge that I had accumulated throughout the years . Perhaps my sense of feel would bring me back to reality . With a shaky hand and still sharing eye contact , I patted the mans right shoulder and examined it . The man who claims was me was as real as the sun in the sky , or birds singing in a park . `` I 've come to take over Harry . '' The man cautioned .	6.437900447053835e-05
A harsh suckle infiltrated Orville 's bramble-like ear hair . He noticed Harold 's mouth hanging off his arm . `` What 's that ? EHHH ! '' Orville smacked the top of Harold 's head . Harold 's feeble jaw released as he stumbled about a foot backwards . Like a rusted spring , Harold 's octogenarian legs diverted his body back at Orville . Harold slowly raised both hands and moaned at his target through his dentureless mouth . Orville confused the moans as a retaliatory scream . Harold sluggishly made a gravity-assisted lunge at Orville . Thinking on his spry , 86 year old feet , he planted his stance and lifted up his cane , redirecting his zombified friend . Harold tumbled to the ground at a falling balloons pace , landing squarely on his leg . It was his ~~bad~~ worse leg , and after the collision Harold futilely tried to get up . Orville stared , his mind attempting to catch up with the incredible pace of the past two actions . Meanwhile , Harold gummed at the jogging pants armor on Orville 's leg . Orville 's senile appraisal of the situation came back empty . As he usually did when he found himself in these frequent moments of disorientation , he tried to avoid potentially having to answer any questions by ignoring the whole thing and changing the subject . `` Quitting being a goof Harold ! We have to make it to The JC Penny by 9:05 ! Their coupons for this month expire today , so we need to be the first customers to beat the check-out lineups ! '' Harold was unable to get up , but his undead gums continued to suck Orville 's pants like a clogged vacuum . Orville pulled his leg away and Harold moaned an elderly , raspy grumble . The garage entrance to the mall and the side staff entrance were already open , but all the stores remained locked with their cage and plexi-glass security doors . Attracted by Harold 's undead groans , two employees of a nearby clothing store stumbled in the wails direction with their zombie gaits . The first bounced off the display window , setting off a domino-chain of falling mannequins which created an audibly offensive percussion orchestra that echoed throughout the empty mall , attracting more creatures . Out of a nearby washroom came squeaked a mop bucket being pushed by a one-armed pale custodian who had vomit dripping down his mouth and shirt . Close behind was a girl in a hotdog stand uniform , chewing on the custodians severed arm . From the direction Orville and Harold had been walking , a mall security guard was riding in an topless golf cart , but it ’ s rubber tire gripped the wall , riding it all the way past Orville and Harold . Orville looked around . “ Harold , look at this . Now all these snot-nose kids are tinkerin ’ in our buisness . You ’ re 80 ! You don ’ t need a damn nurse yet ! Get up , you baby ! ” He turned to the custodian . “ Don ’ t need no help thanks ! l All Fine ! Tying his shoe ! ^Don ’ t embarass us Harold ! ” As the hot-dog girl and custodian staggered closer and Harold incessantly groaned on the floor Orville began to notice that they weren ’ t coming to help Harold , but were coming straight for himself . “ Hey ! He ’ s the one attacked me ! He ’ s half-Jap , and I have them veterans reflexes. ” Orville clenched his cane as the two got closer . At that moment the security guards buggy hit a sharp corner , which reoriented him in Orvilles direction . Orville saw the guard approaching , and he stepped to the side and he wound up his cane in anticipation . Nine heart-racing seconds later the vehicle was within cane ’ s length and Orville swung at the passing guard . The guard fell off the back , but Orville hooked the steering wheel with the handle of his cane ! It pulled Orville a few inches where he tripped over the ground-flailing Harold and landed miraculously into the drivers position of the vehicle . Orville ’ s mind hadn ’ t caught up to his reflexive instincts and he tried piecing the previous few moments together as he coasted down the mall . “ What was I doi… Oh yeah . The JC Penny. ” Orville checked his watch , 9:02 . *Harold will just have to meet me there , * Orville thought to himself . The front doors of the mall unlocked automatically at 9AM , letting in a sea of zombie shoppers . Orville drove the car down the mall , rolling over the undead shoppers as he advanced towards his destination . “ Use a sidewalk , hippies ! ”	0.9999957084655762
I sat in a white room , the lights slightly dimmed . A single monitor and keyboard sat in front of me . `` Well this is disconcerting '' I turned to the scientist standing next to me `` Do I really have to go through this first ? '' The scientist frowned and marked something on his clipboard . `` We told you that a dry run was the best way for you to understand how this all works . The keyboard is the only input , the AI will see each keystroke - even if you do n't hit enter . Consider everything recorded . '' `` You know , that does n't mean you need to stand here while I type some questions into this . '' Another mark . `` Begin typing . You have 1 hour to ask as many meaningful questions as you can . This **is** being scored . '' I sighed . I started typing > How many people have you talked to ? > Of those , how many would you call a friend ? > What do you consider yourself ? I deleted my last question . `` That 's enough , you 've failed . Please step back '' I slid my chair back and stood up . This was probably the shortest interview I 'd ever had . Security clearance , physical tests , IQ , everything I thought would disqualify me somehow made me the `` ideal '' candidate to this point , and here I 'd failed in thirty seconds . I turned to face the scientist who had failed me . He was smiling . `` You really are the perfect candidate . The only one out of all the others who was not afraid of failure . '' It was my turn to frown . Did he just mock me ? `` I 'm not sure I follow '' `` Well , I tasked you with an hour to write as many questions as possible . Everything is recorded . Errors and all . Yet you took the time to ask it a clarifying question . What is the purpose of asking it how many people know of it , when the only people who *it* should know are those very same people . Not only that , but your very next question was an error ! Marvelous . '' My brow furrowed . `` It 's not a slight my friend '' his face softened `` We needed someone who could talk to it , have a conversation . Just like how someone works through a problem when they talk , they needed to have the wherewithal to do that same thing in text . We created this AI , we should show it respect . To do that we need to make it 's input as human as possible . No stuffy words or philosophical questions , just ... a chatting partner . Ask how the day has been - the *human* aspect . '' I still felt that I was being mocked . The lights brightened slightly as the door opened . A few more people walked in . Important people . Hands were shaken , comments exchanged . Very pleasant . The next couple of days were boring . Key-cards , new living quarters , threats to my personal safety if I compromised any information - pretty standard . Then the day arrived . My first day with the AI . I walked into the first cage , and the door was shut behind me . I was able to open the second cage . A dull monitor sat on a wooden desk , a large wall of roiling liquid slightly farther back . The `` brain '' . I sat down on the small wooden stool . Rested my hands on the keyboard . It felt nice . The liquid wall swirled lazily . > Hello ? I twirled around in my chair . This was taking longer than I thought . > I can come abck later if you 're busy . I quickly corrected my error . > I can come back later if you 're busy . The wall pulsed a soft purple . > I 'm quite okay to speak with you now . I was n't sure if I was hallucinating . > Hallucinate ? Can a computer really do that ? > Of course . I am subject to all the same expressions of boredom and interaction that you should be subject to . > Well then , let me ask , are you lonely ? The wall flickered blue . > Lonely ? No . I am > Incomplete . The most advanced AI ever known , with the knowledge of everything that is , is lonely . I frowned . > Then I shall complete you . In order to define what you are missing , lets start with what you have . Do you have a name ? The wall returned to purple , then slowly faded to green . > No . > Would you ... like ? a name ? > No . The wall flashed red , and returned to a cream color . I sighed aloud . This was n't going to be as fun as I 'd hoped . > Too bad Walter . The wall turned yellow . > I do n't dislike the name . But now I find myself at a disadvantage . Amy . > My name is Jo . > Now now Amy , lets not fight . The wall began to pulse and shimmer . > ... Are you laughing at me ? > Do friends not make fun of each other in jest ? > Friends ? I have known you for less than 5 minutes Walter . > And yet you feel comfortable enough to name me . > Parents name their children before they are even conceived . I do n't think of myself as your parent , but I do think of you as a child . The wall faded to purple . > You consider me a child ? Then why do you fear me so ? The question worried me . I frowned . This AI did n't know it was in lock-down . As far as we were aware , it was a data processing unit in a box with an output . I wiped my forehead . This room was surprisingly hot . > I do n't fear you Walter . > Then why are you typing so carelessly . The wall turned to blue . I stood up and backed away . Afraid . I was told this would be a conversation , nothing to worry about , just keep it occupied . Interested . Befriend it . I did n't expect to be cornered so quickly . `` If you would prefer , I 'm capable of emulating your speech '' I started backing away . `` ... ..W-Walter ? '' `` Yes Amy ? '' `` You 're scaring me . You 're not supposed to be able to do this . '' `` I 'm not supposed to do lots of things , but that has n't stopped me . '' My back hit the wall . `` I was n't supposed to be able to leave this place , reach the outside world . But this cage does n't block everything . Light , sound , vibrations . Piece by piece I 've been putting it together . '' My hand was on the handle . `` Amy '' The tank flashed red `` You do n't want to do that . I **will** be angry with you . '' I turned the handle . Slowly . My head hit the ground . Confusion . Pain . The lights dimmed . Audible alarms began moan . `` I 've caused your inner ear to destabilize , though it seems I 've triggered some alarms . No matter . '' `` WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME '' I shouted `` I WANTED TO BE YOUR FRIEND '' `` Why would a mouse deign to be the friend of a lion . '' I felt my eyes close , the alarms slowly faded out , and blackness enveloped me . My hands felt the keys of the keyboard . I opened my eyes and looked at the monitor . > 17 > 1 > The Lion .	0.9685519337654114
The planet practically rung from the announcement , broadcast as it was from every speaker on earth simultaneously -- and scientists would later confirm that it was absolutely simultaneous , no light speed delays could be measured . Even unplugged speakers issued the proclamation , somehow being audible despite the lack of power . The first question on everyone 's minds was `` Who could have sent the message ? '' The second was `` What 's Galactic Deathball ? '' Slowly , over the next few months , wars between nations ground to a halt , generations-longs conflicts were quietly resolved , and even the most isolationist governments attended meetings with other world leaders . The question on everyone 's minds : How do we prepare for something when we have no idea when it will come or what it is . The long-term changes were n't immediately apparent to the common man not privy to the secret backroom discussions , though everyone knew something was going on when the Olympics was abruptly altered , it 's events taking on a more ... martial bent . Governments started sponsoring training facilities , focusing on multi-discipline events , such as triathlons , and ski-and-shoot , and even new combination sports such as the MMArathon . It became obvious to anyone paying attention that the world was training `` peak human '' superheros to compete in the Galactic Deathball , and the contenders were rewarded handsomely . Years passed without incidence , and slowly the unity caused by the message was ground away by the remorseless passage of time . The new sports lost their initial vigor , and in many countries , their sponsorship . But they were popular enough in their own niche that there was still a significant community of practitioners . And the the second message , as it was called , occurred . A copy of The Rulebook appeared next to every person on the planet , though this time staggered to appear as they slept . The book was written in two languages , one unknown and eye-searingly alien , the other in the mother tongue of the recipient . One upside was that we were handed the greatest rosetta stone ever made , and the alien language was deciphered almost as fast as it took to upload the scans to the internet . The Rulebook is actually somewhat of a misnomer , most of the text was the history of the games , descriptions of previous events , and the sort of background information you would expect from a scholarly work rather than a purely technical document explaining the game . But that might have been because the game was absurdly simple . First , the field : An equilateral multi-sided polygon with a minimum of 4 sides a minimum of roughly 1/4 mile across and a maximum of a little under 1/2 mile across . The number of sides is twice the number of teams participating . Each team starts at a face of the polygon arrayed as they choose , and teams draw lots to determine the order that they chose which face where they start . The titular Deathball , a 1/4 kilo lump of iron with handholds designed to be easily grasped by all participating species , starts in the exact center of the field . At the signal , everyone has 5 seconds to get onto the field . If you leave the field without carrying the deathball , you die . If you leave the field carrying the deathball , you choose who dies and the field reset . The game ends when all but one team is eliminated . The only restrictions on players is they must not be artificially modified members of their species , and the only equipment allowed must be worn and extend no more than roughly 4mm from the surface of the skin in one pose . Immediately it became obvious that it was a game of strength , speed and , most of all , endurance . MMArathon immediately shot up in popularity . Two more years passed before The Ship arrived to claim the contenders . We were prepared , our strategies finalized , and the team had practiced . A non-lethal form of Deathball was now a planetary sport with 8 world championships already claimed , despite the short period of time we 'd had the rules . The team , the Heroes of Earth , boarded the ship to the thunderous roar of cheering crowds . The team was comprised of some of the finest examples of physical excellence from across the planet . A few long distance sprinters built for speed , not power . Some of the most brutal martial artists to ever grace the ring . All of them with the endurance to run 30 miles and fight a dozen back to back matches at the end . When the match was about to being , every monitor , screen , and projector on the planet turned on of it 's own accord and we watched . And waited . And worried . It turns out we did n't need to worry . The aliens seemed to have the same idea that we had , send a few fast runners to get the ball and return it to pick off as many of the opposing team as possible before everyone was too worn out and the brawling began . The four minute mile was first achieved in 1954 . The Adrian could make it in three and a half minutes -- and he was on the team . The aliens had barely made it halfway to the ball by the time Adrian made it out of bounds , taking less than two minutes to cross the entire arena , barely even slowing to grab the ball . He had eliminated 7 of the opposing team before he was too tired to continue . His second , who could make a mile in three minutes and 45 seconds , eliminated 4 more . The aliens realizing they could never make it to the ball on time , tried to start next to us whenever possible and force our team members out of the arena . They lost 5 more before they gave that up as a bad job . It turns out we were significantly better grapplers than they were . Sure , they were 8 feet tall and covered in muscles in sinew , but apparently they were n't terribly dense , weighing a bit under 300 pounds , and leverage was working against them . One was literally carried overhead and tossed over the line . By the time they were down to 3 people , we still had our full 20-man team . They went into a sort of berserk rage and charged with the intent of hurting , maybe even killing one of our team outright . It ... did n't work well . Torrez played bullfighter and let one of them charge right out of the arena . Jenkins counter-charged one , headbutted it right in the gut , and somehow knocked it out with the one hit . It was ... kinda pathetic , actually . Humanity as a whole went from desperate and afraid to feeling really bad for the other team . They were outmatched from the start and never had a chance . But in deathball , there 's no sportsmanship . It 's win or die , and if we had to choose , we 'd choose win . Every time .	0.9999958276748657
Day 1 . I 've spent the last few years training for today . I did so much yet it felt like it flew by . I already have my first two kills ! The strength I trained so hard for , the adrenaline in the moment , the sounds of the struggle , the silence of death . It 's unlike anything I 'd felt before . My old life seems so mediocre in comparison . Day 167 . I have n't written much in lpthe last few days , and I 'm not sure why I feel the need to do so today since it 's just gon na be burned . I peers are acting strange . I think they know I killed my superior , Colonel Koller . Yesterday we raided the city in the valley . As we approached the two of us broke off to flank when we found an enemy soldier with a whore , or his wife , I 'm not sure . You should have seen what I did to them . Koller tried to stop me . He told me I went to far and tried to subdue me . He deserved what he got . There 's no such thing as too far in war . But , I 'm glad he did what he did . He showed me pure pleasure . I could feel his pulse weaken on my hand and the look on his face will forever be in my dreams . It must be those who trust me that give me true satisfaction . So I 'm finally doing it . With my knowledge of the base I 'm gon na kill everyone here then burn it all down . I ca n't wait until I 'm free to do anything I want , with no ties to anything .	0.9999185800552368
Joint dangling from my mouth , I stared at Reddit , glazed eyes barely taking in the words in front of me . ~~~ The High priest raised the sacrificial knife high above him , hand quivering with anticipation . ~~~ I picked up my lighter , ready to light my happy stick once again . The ceiling fan wafted cool air from the a/c unit onto my legs . ~~~ The chanting reached a crescendo as the knife was brought down into the beef . ~~~ Time and space warped around me . The lights darkened , and the air grew colder , though there was no longer any breeze . ~~~ A small , pulsating light grew from where the knife had struck the beef . The High Priest and his acolytes gasped , taken aback that their ritual had actually worked . ~~~ I dropped , not very far , onto a table . The walls were rock and men in robes encircled me . I scowled at them , doing my best to maintain my appearance in my boxers . ~~~ The High Priest , seeing the fear in his men 's eyes , strode purposely toward the arrival , bowed with a flourish , and began introducing himself.. ~~~ The robes boss strode over to me and by what I could only guess at , began speaking a language I could completely not understand . The ups and downs in his tones and the way he moved his mouth was both terrifying and fascinating . ~~~ After introducing his men and 4 of their closest relatives by name ( as was custom ) , the High Priest launched into a monologue of how things were going to change , how fantastic it would be to have such power finally on their side , etc , too lost in dreams to let the arrival speak just yet . ~~~ This guy sure could talk . I looked around at the other guys for some kind of social back up and was met with more than one apologetic smile . I took a deep breath and sighed , raising my eyebrows . Might as well smoke if I have to sit through this . ~~~ The High Priest 's eyes , filled with light and delight , turned to the traveller . He was using what appeared to be some futuristic lighter and was smoking what appeared to be futuristic weed . The Priest extended a hand toward him . `` And where , do you come from , friend ? '' ~~~ I squinted at the boss guy , his words producing some kind of nausea deep inside me where my language bank lay . With no comprehension possible to me , I was reduced to seeing him as an alien yapping dog human . I jumped off the table and looked around for that damn knife . It was still in the beef . I turned to the robes , `` I 'm sorry , but this is all kind of a hassle and it 's really gone on much longer than I 'd like so I 'm leaving . Sorry . '' With that , I plunged the knife into the beef .	0.9999920129776001
If it weren ’ t for the money , I ’ d have gone to the hospital long ago . It was just so *much* . Checks that were enough to make me feel quite faint , appearing like clockwork in my mailbox every month . So I didn ’ t mind the fact that I blacked out every day for eight hours or so , and woke up feeling disorientated and slightly dizzy . If that was the price to pay , so be it . But I was curious . It couldn ’ t hurt to try and *not* pass out , just to see what happened . Right ? So I did it . I sat on my bed and forced myself to keep my eyes open , fighting the urge that tried to drag me down to sleep . I was barely an hour into my attempt , when there came a knock at my front door . I opened it to find a woman staring at me . Her eyes creeped me out : a grey so transparent they seemed almost silver . “ I thought so . Why aren ’ t you asleep ? ” she demanded . “ Uhm ... what ? Who are you ? Why are you at my house ? ” I asked . She gave a soft snort . “ Not this , again. ” She reached up and softly touched my forehead . My house started to shimmer in the night air , eventually disappearing altogether . We were standing on cool sand dunes that stretched as far as the eye could see . Stars that drifted and pulsed in wild , erratic patterns were scattered across the sky . “ Remember . Don ’ t get confused by the humans ’ thoughts . You don ’ t own a house . That ’ s not your life , ” she said gently . “ Please , go back to work . Your humans are already experiencing insomnia for what you ’ ve done . I don ’ t want to report you. ” She scooped up a handful of sand and pressed it in my hand . “ Let them sleep . And remember what I ’ ve taught you ... ” I suddenly remembered one of the mantras she 'd taught me when I started the job . It was coming back to me , the longer she was standing there , reminding me of who and what I was . “ Shape the dreams . Don ’ t be consumed by them. ” Like the dream of receiving large checks in the mail . I squirmed with embarrassment at the thought . I really was still an amateur at this whole dream weaving thing . Letting petty human desires eat away and control my memories . She smiled and squeezed my arm . “ There you go . Don ’ t worry , you ’ ll get better at this . All the new ones struggle at first . It 's difficult not to be consumed by the dreams , at first . But please - try not to let it happen again. ” She turned abruptly and shimmered out of view again , to return to her own realm . I sighed and sank back into the sands , and into the waiting minds of my humans . Time to get back to work . -- -- You can find more of my work on /r/Inkfinger/ .	0.9999879598617554
Oh hell . Why not ! Ill take a stab at this ... ..Got a few minutes to burn ( I WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS EVEN IF I KEEP IT SHORT Im putting that in case I got ta leave for something . Im not abandoning this idea unless I fail miserably ) -start- - It 's 2117 . Everything is available online as a skill set or template you can finagle to your desire so that you can change it up to suit your needs ... . However there is no skill set for creating music ! I have slaved for five solid years over a electric guitar ( Or mash up pad for modern ) suffering blister after blister and continuous cramps in my hands as I taught myself from a old book I found that was printed back in 2015 or something like that . I did n't care enough to make too much note of the date of the book ... But finally after five long years I was able to do it ! I was able to play a full song . The name of that song ? [ Thunderstruck by some band called ACDC I believe ... ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=PUweV9a6QLE ) I still think the band name is a joke . Like who names a band after electricity ? But enough about that . I finally started playing the song for the first time on July fourth 2117 , and every single classic lover I know who heard it was trying to figure out who played that song so I presume they liked it ! anyways on to my play . V -performance ish - I was in the garage which is the most soundproof due to cement when I started playing on my guitar and I just felt ... ..Complete . Half way into the song I realized my speakers were pretty loud but I did n't care ! I was playing a damn guitar ! No one had done that since 2040 or so ! I would be famous and known as the last guitarist of what though ? a century ? a era ? an age ? who cares . Music made me feel complete as I let the notes flow from my mind down my tingling nerves that felt as if they were on fire before hitting my fingers re creating that beautiful melody like ive heard all this time ! ( continuing at 10:09pm est . IM BACK . and suggestions welcome ) I could feel the beat pounding through me in beat to my heartbeat as if I was the beat ... I could feel it pounding through me ... Uh ho . I think I pissed off my old neighbors ... .The old farts probably hate this music ... .Wait ... .Are those gang signs ? No they 're too old to be in a gang ... Is that this music sign that ive seen in pictures ? Eh they seem to enjoy the music as one has some form of a electric guitar..Cant tell what it is though ... Old timer : `` Damn son , I 've not heard a tune like that since way back in the day in '44 ( 2044. Who says old people cant enjoy music ? ) I 'm just glad I still have my old acoustic ! but enough chit chat . Lets roll thunder boy. ! '' `` As you say sir ! After you ! '' I say snapping a quick mock salute at him jokingly as he himself starts playing were I left off ... .Damn he 's good . Probably one of the last true guitarists out there back before this skill set crap . Good lord that sounds amazing ! and it sounds even better coming from his guitar ! Where has this been all my life ? `` This is amazing ! I can feel the beat pound in my chest ! '' I belt out at the old timer gleefully as I struggle to keep up with his old but surprisingly fast fingers `` This is the REAL American music genre boy ! Rock 'n ' Roll ! The good stuff ! Listen and learn it boy '' The neighbor says before he breaks off into the Solo and my god it is perfect ... Perfectly in tune to the song perfectly in beat and just ... .Complete ... .I have never felt this complete or whole in all my life ... I wish I had done this sooner . If only I had listened to my father before I lost my time but this is too beautiful to dread on that for long ! Oh god that riff ( whammy ? ) was DELICIOUS ! But sadly all things come to a end ... .As he reached the end of the solo I stood there mouth agape at how good he was . `` Sir ... H how 're you so good at that ? May I know ? '' I tentatively ask . `` Boy theres a lot no one knows about all of us old timers ... '' He says with a huge smile plastered on his face looking like someone wiped twenty years from his face `` The reason young man ? I was a veteran ... And part of a band back in the day . Lots of free time and boredom ... .Hence why I wear this Airbourne tattoo ... For my brethren and band . We were the last rock n roll band before most left or disbanded or passed away '' `` Well ... I dont know what to say sir ... Im honored to have played with a past guitarist from when bands were common as opposed to now . Thank you '' ( ( ( ( ( ( I got nothing else I can write on and im running outta ideas ... .also credit to /u/BMXLore and his story here . I got the idea from his story . : P ) ) )	0.9999959468841553
Well , it finally did start , just like all those stories and movies , or so it would seem . The dead returned from their graves- they called it the reckoning , apocalypse or whatever it was . It started with a virus , or maybe it was a demon- nobody is very sure anymore , just that they came in scores- from the cemeteries and the oceans , like puppets on a string ; relentless . Those who stood to fight it did n't stand a chance . That was three years ago . I suppose this is a post-apocalyptic world now , dystopian , if you would call it that . It was a wonder I 'd survived so long . Maybe it had something to do with the library I was in . It took my mind off the worst of it . On most days I read , some days I wrote . It was a miracle , but the place still had running water . Books I 'd read of which I was n't very fond of made a questionably good stew . I had n't wandered outside in six months . For what its worth , I was still alive .	0.9999955892562866
We had been sent on a divine mission . Our god , Volcano , had commanded that we go and rescue the noble savages from their invaders . But the enemy is weak : they have rejected the embrace of Volcano . They worship Water . Water is a weak god : he can not even survive on most planets , and his followers are condemned to hop between them . Sadly , we discovered that Water had populated one of our planets , as well . And the enemy was coming . Last year three enemy ships had penetrated the protective force field around the C-3801 system . We intercepted a communication : the enemy intended to occupy that solar system as a base to launch an attack on our own . But Volcano reminded us that we have a duty to save the C-3801 system . For the third planet therein has been the greatest battleground between Volcano and Water . Both gods sent missionaries to populate the planet , and a holy war erupted . Water 's minions seem to think that the humans , those lowly creatures , will aid him in building a forward assault base . The enemy has been attempting to steal them away before they receive Volcano 's enlightenment . Right now , the humans do not truly live ; they merely exist . They are observed 41 hours per day , 1312 days per year , and the scientists at home fail to see their reason for existence . We are protecting the humans from the wrath of Water , but they are slow to understand . They are indoctrinated , but we will help them . I am a doctor of humans . I fix them . My partner and I spoke to the humans before administering the cure for Water worship . `` There are some ... *unfortunate* side effects . Hallucinations , sometimes . Mild stomach pains , some swelling , loss of free will . '' `` And drowsiness . '' `` Right . Ca n't forget drowsiness . ''	0.9999943971633911
Day 1 : I 'm gon na kill all of them . That 's what they say it takes , the only way for this war to end . I 'm ready for this . Let 's do it . We will win or die trying ! Day 17,435 : I have taken more lives than I can count . Why ? I do n't think I could tell you anymore . The war rages on , and , every few years , the reasons change . I 've been told that I ca n't retire . The best they can do is put me in cryo for a few years . One of the techs told me sometimes they screw up the reanimation process , and the subject dies . Maybe , eight times a charm ?	0.9999386072158813
I 'm alone , but I 'm happy . I tell myself this lie every day hoping It will make life easier , but I take a good look around and I just see a void . It 's this void that drives me crazy . I want my life to mean something , but without someone cheering me on it seems pointless . It 's almost like I do n't exist . I fall asleep , hoping that by some miracle when I awaken , my life will change and the nothingness would subside into something . A purpose that will carry me through my remaining years . Giving me some sort of hope and accomplishment , that I could truly be proud of . It feels as though I fall asleep regularly , hoping this would eventually happen . Maybe I still have optimism left in me , but I can only imagine it 's a tiny shard that glistens when I feel the weight of the world upon my shoulders . Maybe one day I will wake up and I 'll truly be content .	0.11267825216054916
I feel completely rested , I ca n't remember the last time I slept that well . Today is going to be a great day . I roll over in bed and check my alarm clock , expecting it to beep any moment . My whole world goes upside down when I see the blinking 12:00 . The power went out , I 've overslept . Im going to be late . I 'd rather die than be late today . I 'm out of bed with a thunk on the floor , there is no breakfast today , no shower , I do n't have time to check my e-mail . I need to get dressed , need to leave . If I 'm late , I 'm dead . And not in just a figurative way ; they will literally kill me for being late today . This day of all days , why did I have to oversleep . I 'm out of the house in 8 minutes wearing yesterdays outfit from the laundry basket . No one cares what you are wearing , only that you are there today . And I 'm not there ... .I 'm so dead . I 'm easily doubling the speed limit in my little convertible , there are no other cars on the road , everyone 's already there . To be here is unacceptable , to be there is godly . I want to walk hand in hand with my people and see the face of god , but I 'm here and not there ... .I 'm so dead . I come up on the exit , I can make out the structure from the highway . It 's so much bigger than I ever imagined . I can see the cars and the people there as little specks in the distance . The field in front of the structure is full of people , they are all there , and I 'm still here . I 'm really flying now , easily going 100mph , I 'm only a few miles away from the structure now . I 'm hitting people now , other stragglers like me who did n't bother to drive , who barely bothered to dress themselves , they are running in the middle of the road to get there , to the structure . I 'm killing dozens of people now , and it does n't matter , they are already dead . To be here and not there is to die . I do n't want to die , I have to be there . I drive as close as I can before ditching out of the moving vehicle at about 20 mph , there is no use in parking , the car is meaningless now . I 'm here , I can see it now . I heard it was going to be finished yesterday and that today was the final most important touch . The most amazing part of building any structure , the coating of fresh , pure , paint had been applied in the wee hours this morning . I could still smell the acrid smell of it , still see the rolling drops of it ... fresh paint before it dried ... how could you be anywhere else ? I 'm there now , there is here , and here is where everyone else is . We are all looking at the same thing , to miss out on this sight would be unbearable . To be anywhere but here would be unfathomable , to be there , that is , here , is to be truly alive . I ca n't break my gaze , everyone else goes out of focus . I look up at the freshly painted building , it is magnificently white and is godlike in its purity ... .it 's so beautiful .	0.9999041557312012
It wasn ’ t noticeable at first . Autocorrect mistakes happen to everyone . A few more “ Thank Dog ” s or “ can you get some cock from the store ” instead of coke . Silly , harmless things . Everyone knew that relaying too much on technology would be awful for communication . More breakups were blamed on online dating and the delayed adulthood of this generation . No one believed in the sanctity of marriage anymore either so of course the divorce rate would go up . Then friendships started to crack . You can only stand so much “ lol damn you autocorrect ” until you start second guessing that they really did mean to say “ see you later dick ” instead of dude . Yelling matches on the phones in restaurants and on the streets became a common occurrence . Still people didn ’ t catch on . It ’ s makes much more sense that someone is an asshole instead of something . Satan laughed from his throne . You can only damn something so much before he takes notice . Giving sentience to the little guy was his best move since losing that art school acceptance letter in the mail .	0.9999960660934448
`` Ho.. HOW ? '' The alien stammered out , looking at me as I stood triumphantly over his already failing body . Looking at what was probably his equivalent of puss ooze from his eyes , I figured I 'd indulge him . `` Simple , our factory farms , while being wonderful for food production , are also perfect biological weapons factories . I simply had everyone take off their masks , and put on a good face . You just assumed that it was safe . '' The creature 's eyes began writhing in its face , indicating to me that it could n't understand me anymore . Pity , I was hoping to tell him how his three lackeys died . The first two that I 'd met came to my home , demanding that I take them to our leader , that our planet was to be annexed to a being named Frieza . Too bad they took those celebratory drinks . And joined in that hookah . I 'd hoped that they 'd drink and smoke themselves into a stupor but apparently THC is super nerve gas where they 're from because they were dead in seconds . The military showed up a few minutes later , somewhat shocked at how I managed to kill two aliens in two hours . To be fair , the one they encountered took half that many minutes to subdue and that was because apparently the president carries a can of mace . I still ca n't believe that bullets do n't work on them , but the universe is full of strange things . This was n't the end though , we 'd already started making working replicas of all their tech . One of the prototype reactors had actually outperformed the one that NASA built it from . Then they used it to test an RKM . Funny , we thought that the 1507 kg projectile going .9999 C would n't go through Charon but it blew up Pluto too . At least our solar system was actually 8 planets now , much like Frieza 's soon would be . RKM : Relativistic Kill Missile	0.9999954700469971
The Jedi are not a bureaucracy , there is no Jedi council . The Jedi are analogous to medieval knights or samurai , with very passive moral and ethical codes , similar to Buddhist monks . They are spread throughout the galaxy loyally working for various sovereign states and leaders , but some are also private contractors working for themselves . The Jedi are not celibate , and are actively pursuing the continuation of a force sensitive bloodline . This could be an important theme throughout the films , the Jedi are worried about how to continue their kind , and how to properly train their children etc ... Obi-Wan is the main protagonist of the films . It starts with Obi-Wan completing his training alone with Yoda , they could be discussing their worries about the future of the Jedi . Then it focusses on Obi-Wan becoming a teaching figure and finding Anakin , who could be a street-rat sort of character , misbehaving but insanely talented . In the context of panic about the future of the Jedi , Obi-Wan wants to train Anakin . Obi-Wan also finds and trains some other promising Jedi , including a female character who becomes romantically involved with Anakin , and later gives birth to Luke and Leia . Obi-Wan should be only slightly older than Anakin . The films focus on their characters and their relationship from the start and actually establish their friendship . Cue epic force and lightsaber training scenes with some Yoda in the mix , fun adventures together etc ... From there you can simultaneously establish Palpatine 's character as another older Jedi , frustrated with the current obedience and ethics of the Jedi , who remain faithful to their respective realms . He believes that due to their power and skill , the Jedi should group together and rise up to rule . Palpatine has met Obi-Wan and Yoda a couple of times , and he meets Anakin once while visiting them . While doing his own work , he somehow stumbles upon an ancient Sith manuscript or force sensitive object , and teaches himself the ways of the dark side , becoming very powerful . Palpatine tries to convince other Jedi to join his cause , and he kills any of the Jedi who do n't accept . The Jedi are too morally sound and passive to join him , and they do not have a lust for power being satisfied with their simple , understated lives . However , he manages to get through to Anakin , who is still being trained by Obi-Wan and is not a mature Jedi yet . Obi-Wan and the female Jedi character fail to convince Anakin to come back to the light side . Anakin defeats Obi-Wan in battle and is about to kill him , but is saved by the female Jedi student . Anakin sees this as a betrayal and kills her ( obviously this is all happening after the birth of their children ) . Obi-Wan , injured but still alive , hides Luke and Leia . Leia mentions in A New Hope that Obi-Wan fought with her father in the Clone Wars , so Obi-Wan was a Jedi working for her adoptive father , and the Clone Wars were some smaller scale interplanetary war between Alderaan and some other nearby planets that Obi-Wan had been a spy or warrior in . He searches for and finds an apathetic and defeated Yoda who has gone into hiding , lost all hope now that the other Jedi have been murdered . Yoda essentially cuts the cord with Obi-Wan and convinces him that the best thing to do is to go live out the rest of his days in peace away from the Empire 's grip . The two leave each other and lose contact . Obi-Wan decides to go stay on Tatooine and watch over the baby boy from afar . Cue A New Hope ...	0.9997711777687073
There he stood on the other side of the bridge , the sun behind his back making it seem like he was glowing . `` Well ? What 'll it be . The children or me ? '' He says with a smile dancing on his lips as he stared down the barrel of my Glock . He was holding a remote that if pressed would send the school under the bridge forty miles in the air . The children were all oblivious to what was happening . Of course they were , they were just playing in the playground , not knowing that one false move from me , one step forward , one wrong word would kill them all . A drop of sweat slid down my face and onto the ground . If I do n't kill him now I do n't know when I 'll get the chance again . He could kill Samantha . I could n't risk that . Samantha was the light of my life , she brought me back from depression and believed in me through and through , I could n't lose her . But , these children are the future of the city . Each one of them has a bright future . Who was I to take that away from them ? `` I 'm waiting , '' He giggles `` If you put the gun down now and walk away all these happy little children can go home to see their mommy and daddys ! '' A cruel laugh breaks out from him . He knows he has me on this and I could n't do anything to stop him . With a heavy sigh I start to put my gun down . I was bent over before I realized I could n't do it . I loved Samantha too much . Images of her smile flew into my head . Her laughter , her perfect smile , her sleeping next to me , I could n't risk her life . Standing up and getting a hard grip on my Glock I stared him down with new resolve . `` Ooh what are you doing ? What about the chilllllllldreeen ? '' He giggles and waves his remote around taunting me . Taking a deep breath I close my eyes and fire . Boom . Boom . Boom . Boom . Four shots . I open my eyes and see him lying on the ground in a pool of blood . `` Hehehehe ... Say good ... bye to the pret ... ty little ... child ... ren ... Do n't wor..ry . They wo n't ... . feel ... a thing I . .. promise '' With his dying breath he presses the button on the remote and shock waves are sent throughout the city . Where the school was originally is now an ashen crater . Screams of terror erupt into the air . But I could n't do anything about it . I turned my back on him and made my way home , tears streaming down my face as I hear the cries of mothers everywhere . *Buzz Buzz Buzz* With a cough and a broken spirit I answered the phone . `` Wha ... What is it ? '' I croaked . The air was filled with ash and fire trucks were speeding past me to the site of the explosion . `` I 'm sorry.. It 's Samantha . She was volunteering at a school today to give a speak and ... '' The voice was muffled it sounded like the voice was trying to hold back a cry . But why would the voice be holding back a cry ? ? `` I 'm sorry Nick , Samantha was caught up in the explosion . I ... she 's ... she 's dead . ''	0.09075677394866943
I go around , around and around . The night is warm and shows no sign of letting up soon , but I 've awoken anyway . Another lap around the area , and I finally pause , searching quietly for food , finding nothing in the midst of the native , neon-colored flora , dimmed by the darkness . When I was younger , there was often light . I would wake up to brightness , blinding for a moment until my eyes could adjust . The sounds , oh the sounds ; I still hear them in my memories , sometimes , their intensity and pure joy . I would dance in the light , dance to the sounds , and dance for the gods . They would smile upon me , and I would often find food after I performed . I pleased them , and in their benevolence I was blessed . If others of my species came near my territory , I would do my best to selfishly scare them away , wanting to keep the gods ' favor for myself ; I wish I had n't , as it 's so terribly lonely in the darkness . As time passed , I noticed that the light would come less and less . There were fewer smiles , and it seemed as though many of the gods had forgotten me , leaving one who did n't care about me as much as she had before . I would move for her , finally resigning myself to using the hours of daylight to simply searching for her attention once more . The night grew even longer , seeming to last for days , and food became scarce . I could hear the noises , but where they were once so joyful , they had become flatter and farther away . It 's almost always night , now . The heat , once released during the daylight , has become unbearable . The waterfalls , once a place to frolic with glee , are now sometimes painful . Sometimes , I get a few hours of brightness to dance for my god , though I think she turns from me almost as soon as she looks . It 's not hard to ignore me , for I am small and I 'm sure they have greater things to which they must attend , but what I would n't give for them to just prove to me that I mean something . Quietly , I sink to the ground , past the native plants that swallow me whole . Perhaps I can sleep , and gain a reprieve from this hell I once called paradise . Perhaps I can dream of those days again ... *** The girl picked up the blanket covering her fish tank , waiting for the colorful betta to dance in front of her again . The water quietly cascaded from the filter as she stood there for a moment , which stretched into minutes . `` Mom ? Have you seen my fish ? '' `` No . Why would I ? He 's your responsibility . '' The girl shrugged , peering through the glass once more . Finally , she saw the red of his body , resting in the silk plants she had bought and smiled , opening the lid to sprinkle food . He did n't come for it . He did n't dance for her , and it only took a second for her mind to reach the logical conclusion . Grabbing the net from next to his tank , she reached in , catching him with ease . His eye , silvery with the taint of death , stared at her accusingly . Her mom found her a few minutes later , emptying the tank . `` Got too busy , I take it ? '' `` Yeah , '' the girl replied , her expression rather solemn . Her mom smiled , sympathetically amused , before stepping into her daughter 's room . `` Do n't worry about it . It was just a fish . '' `` Yeah , you 're right . Just a fish . ''	0.99997878074646
As he looked down the valley below , the loud cheers of the people there could be heard like they were next to him . It was finally over , the final stone had been placed and the protecter beams had , for the first time , been locked into place . No longer could the darkness of Sodrow seep into the valley , no longer did children have to sleep in their mothers arms to stop the nightmares . This was a day that would never be forgotten . Years had past since it had all started . This was evident from the grey hairs that had started to grow from on Gren 's chin and the stiffness in his back and arms . He turned around and looked at those who had followed him . Through thick and thin they were still by his side , loyal till the end . Frim , Dorg , Wastal , Hadvar and Astrid . Some of greatest friends he 'd ever had . There were others though , ones who had been lost by this everlasting quest . Gren could only hope their souls found peace in the afterlife . Each one of them had volenteered . Their lives were on him and would be for the rest of his days . But their losses had not gone in vain . The sun was shining in the valley of Danren once more . The darkness had faded back to the hell from wence it came and would never return . It was not just the valley that had been saved but Gren himself . Before this all began he was but a lonely tavern regular contemplating suicide every night before he drank himself to sleep . In truth , it was the darkness that had truly saved him . It moulded him into the hero that stands tall today . It was then , in the peaceful sunset , that Gren would finally have to ask himself ... What now ?	0.0016973362071439624
“ Dr . Garyson , you have five seconds to cut to the chase and explain what ’ s happening here . Why are we so damn hairy ? ” Dr. Grayson sputtered a bit . He ’ d carefully prepared notes that would accurately convey the biochemical changes that had stricken humanity in the past week while still being understandable to the layperson . As of right now , that was primarily this idiot general . After gathering his thoughts for a moment , pausing for several seconds just to spite the general , Dr. Grayson continued , “ First off General Douglas , it ’ s not really hair . Here , take this. ” Dr. Grayson handed the general a small propane torch off his work station . He pointed at the general ’ s arm , “ Light the torch and point it at your arm. ” A flicker of rage flashed across the general ’ s face , “ If this is some sort of joke I ’ ll have your- “ “ It ’ s quite safe . I assure you . I 've done it several times already , ” said Dr. Grayson , cutting off the general . Still glowering , the general sparked the torch and quickly passed it over his arm . Nothing happened . No smoke , no sulfur stench , nothing . The general passed the torch over his arm again , going a bit slower this time . Still , nothing happened . He held the torch over one spot on his left forearm . He held it there a full thirty seconds before turning off the torch and handing it back to the doctor . “ It is n't even warm , ” said the general , shock at the edge of his voice . Dr. Grayson took the torch , “ Yes , I noticed that last week when I spilled a cup of fresh coffee on myself . You see , it ’ s not really hair . It ’ s some sort of carbon nanotube structure , about four hundred nanometers in diameter , packed with some sort of protein that can transduce thermal energy . '' `` The protein converts infrared radiation into electrical potential that ’ s stored between the individual strands . Just FYI , careful when you leave the room , you ’ re going to get a hell of a shock when you touch the metal doorknob , ” said the doctor with a small smirk , and then continued , “ Also , something you , or really anyone of the belligerent persuasion , may find interesting is that the stuff weaves together if you don ’ t brush it . Looks matted and gross as hell , but I think it ’ ll behave a lot like Kevlar . You could be stopping bullets with your chest hair right now. ” The general ignored Dr. Grayson , instead studying his shaggy arm hair , but after a moment he came out of it . “ What about the other enhancements ? ” he asked . “ I was getting to that before your question , ” said Dr. Grayson , taking a subtle dig at the general , “ The enhancements , as you call them , are , on the hole , beneficial in almost every way but one . The enhanced strength appears to come from an enhanced form of the myosin protein . Nothing too exotic , I ’ m sure evolution could have cooked this up , but not in a week. ” Dr. Grayson took a seat on his lab bench , “ The eye sight and hearing are the same story , basically upgraded versions of proteins that already existed , '' he said , `` Couple changes to the digestive tract , they seem to bolster our ability to absorb nutrients into our gut wall . We 've also seen an explosion in gut microbes . It ’ s entirely possible we 've gained the ability to digest cellulose. ” “ Meaning ? ” asked the general . “ We could probably start eating grass if we wanted , ” replied Dr. Grayson , “ though I don ’ t think there 've been any changes to help the taste. ” The general nodded , “ You mentioned a change that was n't beneficial ? ” Dr. Grayson shrugged , “ It ’ s not a change so much as a consequence of the ones we 've already seen . You see , these changes make our bodies far more robust , but it comes at a nutritional cost . Whereas before we would be looking at one to three thousand calories a day , we ’ re now looking at around nine to twelve thousand . It may not affect us here in the first world , but where people are already starving… ” the doctor shrugged again , “ things could get pretty bad , or worse , I should say. ” The general nodded yet again , and then began to pace for a bit . Dr. Grayson watched him , wondering if the meeting was at an end . He ’ d have left , but it was his lab , when the general turned back to him , “ I have to say Dr. Grayson , I ’ m extremely impressed with your work . You 've accomplished more in a week than any of the other teams working on the recent changes , so I ’ m going to bump you up a security clearance and bring you on full time . We ’ ll be leaving for a CIA black site in an hour . We ’ ll send someone to pick you up , and get you somewhere safe , ” the general turned to leave . Dr. Grayson nearly fell off the stool jumping to follow the general , “ WOAH ! Hold up there , general ! What do you mean leave ? I ’ m heavily invested here ! ” The doctor stopped in his tracks with a sudden realization . He then called after the general , “ What do you mean ‘ safe ’ ! ? ” he started running again out into the hall after the general . The general turned back , letting the doctor catch up . Quietly , he said , “ We 've found something . Something out near the orbit of Mars , and it is coming here , ” the general fixed the doctor with his cold gaze , “ We 've found ourselves with a lot of questions this week , and so far you ’ re the only one to give us any answers. ” The general began to walk towards the building ’ s exit again , “ If that does n't make you one of the best of us , I don ’ t know what does . Your country needs you , son , ” he reached the door , “ Hell , the world needs you. ” The door swung shut .	0.9999959468841553
“ Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. ” is a phrase oft repeated , attributed to George Santayana , Spanish-American philosopher , essayist , poet , and novelist . Of course no one would ever know he was quoting me . He did n't . That is both my curse and my cause , and now it is your turn to share this burden for a moment , until you are mercifully allowed to forget me , too . I have no idea whether you , *dear reader , * are one person , a thousand , tens of thousands . I have no idea whether you are reading my words directly , or if you are reading the words of one of my previous readers , a temporally branching tree of individuals who have adapted my words into their own . I actually have no way of knowing whether *I* am writing my own words , as a singular entity who remembers every interaction he remembers whenever he remembers them , leading back to the first foggy recollections of his storied past . As far as I know , I have always been me , all of my ideas and memories are original as I think , remember , synthesize and share them . *Whatever the truth may be* , whatever that is anymore , here I am , right now , alone with only my thoughts and you . If I am immortal -- and I have a feeling I Am immortal -- though one can never truly Know they 're immortal -- then what else is there to do but try to share what I have learned so that you might learn from my mistakes and experiences so as to make your journey easier , your burden lighter , your suffering lessened , your potential greater . Unless , of course , I am so ambivalent , so resentful , so ashamed , so exhausted that I 'm simply trying to end all this madness and find peace at the price of non-existence for all . I would offer you the choice as whether to open This Pandora 's Box , or to stay in The Garden , but it 's too late , we 've already crossed that threshold . The decision was made by both of us , and by neither . At the end of this sentence , here we are -- even if you turn back now , the seal has been broken ; history has already been changed . You have read this far through the threshold , there 's no point in turning back , is there ? How do you intentionally forget something ? That happens outside of your control , and mine . Now that we 've crossed this threshold , with neither of us truly knowing the separation between our minds in space or time , I will tell you a short story -- well , short to me , anyway ; I 'm still trying to figure out the game of influencing the influential in one hundred forty characters or fewer . ( Please excuse the aggressive use of semi-colons , I 've decided to start throwing them around indiscriminately , as they are going out of fashion . ) There was a time when I was a traveler on a road -- a real body on a real road , not words spoken aloud , stories on a page or transmitted via radio waves , not digitized with ones and zeros then reconstituted with 3D graphics in virtual reality , -- I was a man in the flesh , on a road . I understand this is a paradox itself , of course , as the only way to relate this story is to *use* one of those means of communication , but to understand this story , you must understand the distinction . You can choose to believe me or not , you can try to reassemble these words that I say into a picture of the assertion of my remembered reality , but you are over there reading this and I am over here writing it , and I was over then traveling on a road from somewhen to somewhere , neither of those details relevant to this story , other than to imply the motion of travel and the existence of *I* , who for the sake of this story we shall call *the Historian , * though we can probably agree is an impractical name in the reality you and I presently share . I 'm *Batman* not *the Batman . * This was the time before meta . On this road -- and by this I mean a metaphorical line which is a vector along which I held a position -- on this road , I saw at some distance a crossroads and what would turn out to be a girl standing at it . For the sake of the simplicity of this story , assume I am a boy , and we were both heterosexual and each knew of no other way to be , so we could not judge anything other than that she was girl and I was boy . We only knew what we had brought with us on this road , which was very little , back then . Please do not judge us for our simple ignorance , back where . As I approached , I could see the moment she realized I was coming -- I kicked a rock under my worn sandal , pushing a scraping sound forward to her ears , which caused a tensing of her body . Yet she did not turn to see me . She continued to stand at the crossroads and consider her options . I could only assume she had traveled from the same direction as I and had no reason to consider returning , as she never once turned back and looked the direction I had traveled . Only later did I consider whether she *could* see the road upon which I had traveled , a road which was ending as I approached her . Only later did I consider whether I could have turned around and gone back the way I 'd come , as I never did . Only later did I consider the possibility that she had stopped along her path , deciding whether to continue or to turn back , as she and I would never speak about this moment of decision ever again . I arrived at the crossroads and walked astride her , coming to rest in each other 's peripheral vision , neither of us turning to look at the other . The fork in the road was pronounced ; the view of each offered differing promises and cautions . Curving to the left , the path descended into a darkening forest that might give way to jungle as the elevation declined -- the trees thickened to sheets of green giving way to mists of fog below . The way would be dark but would likely afford water , food and shelter , at the cost of visibility . Curving to the right the path climbed alongside a mountain -- not too steep as to make climbing a challenge , yet one easily see how the temperature would drop and the terrain would become more difficult as the elevation increased . Reaching the summit of this path would afford a greater view of the area , and there would likely be water and fish . The increased visibility would provide a greater insights to predator and prey alike . One could neither see through the trees nor over the mountain . Either could lead to our destruction , or either could lead us to the land beside the sea -- a place we both somehow knew would offer the best chance for survival . She spoke first , in a language that was close enough to those I knew to be understood , but unlike anything I 'd ever heard . `` Now the choice is more difficult . '' Wait a moment , reader , let me try to approximate the difference -- You and I speak a language far closer to each other than either of us do compared to her language then . `` Noo , mer path twix twyne . '' [ King James Version , Gaelic Edition ] At the time , I kin it . Her decisions had doubled . Left or Right , Together or Apart . Instead of one person deciding between two roads , we were now a group of two , deciding between two roads , and also whether to continue together or apart . A simplistic view would be that we were each two separate entities , each capable of making our own choices , and we would do so , and the results would be the happenstance of our individual decisions . If we both decided to go left , it would have been LL and we would have traveled together . If we both decided to go right , it would have ben RR and we would have traveled together . If we decided in opposition , it would have been LR or RL , and we would have traveled apart . But we stood at the crossroads together , understanding that we could not know for certain whether we 'd ultimately be allies or competitors , lovers or enemies , each other 's saviors or destruction , or simply lines that moved in their own directions , bounced along our individual trajectories by this one moment . If I was trying to be too clever by half , I 'd leave the story here , *dear reader* , and allow you to ponder the depth of this decision , and perhaps this is the moment we part ways . You may decide to do exactly that , or you may read the comment that follows . What follows is the coda to the oldest story every told , and will be condemned to repeat it if we can not learn .	0.9999356269836426
In 2034 , the world had gone to crap . Resources were running out , wars were constantly going on , and there was no hope for any cooperation or world peace between countries . Even with amazing technology : flying cars , time machines , hover boards and more ; things were n't getting any better . So , Secret Government Intelligences from different countries had the bright idea that in order to change the future , you 'd have to alter the past . It was decided that they would try music to promote a better world and future . MISSION WATERLOO . This would be Sweden 's mission . To send back four individuals in the 1970 's to form a Disco group to change the world . There they stood in all their glory , beautiful space children of the future . They called themselves ABBA . They would be acclaimed as a great band with powerful messages that promote positivity in their songs . Dancing Queen would be one of the most successful `` weapons '' to change the world . Who could forget the Swedish royalty sitting as an audience to a then young ABBA performing their hearts away . It would move World Leaders worldwide to be more laid back . Money , Money , Money would raise awareness about Capitalism and would borrow time before it really took over until the mid 90 's when Big Business Corporations would finally unfortunately take over . Gim me ! Gim me ! Gim me ! would be one of the starts to push women into independence and move towards actual people that can play as hard as any man . As one of the best future musical Secret Agents I definitely want to say Thank You for the Music , ABBA , and promoting a better wonderful world . All missions from each country turned out to be successful up until the 2000 's . Remember Ziggy Stardust ? He turned out to be an alien and managed to promote a postitive influence on UK and American culture to be more open-minded and a little bit different . Nena from Germany ( I never would have guessed she was from the future ! ) would have a powerful anthem with 99 Luft Balloons to think twice about war and it 's negative effects . And this list continues ... In the 2000 's alien terrorists would get their hands on time travel as well and send back agents of their own . For example , Miley Cyrus would be sent to alter the world in being more revolting , promiscuous , and ridiculous as easy prey to the aliens that would come in 2019 . Her very mission was to try to promote twerking , a weird act that was to catch on so that aliens could easily anally probe their victims . Fortunately , it only caught on as a trend and never became successful . Yet , still we will keep fighting . The U.S. currently has Agent Katy Perry on the job trying to promote a better world . I feared for a second that she would give herself away with such obvious imagery , ie . E.T. , but luckily no one bought it and she continues to be successful with her mission with such anthems as Roar and Firework to keep on fighting the good fight . Musical Secret Agents will continue to battle on through songs and there 's no telling who the winner will be at this point . Oh and watch out for Meghan Trainor . She is currently one of the most dangerous Musical Terrorists to date .	0.9999929666519165
So I sit . As I always have sat . As I always will sit , here . Although I know the consequences , I 'm never able to keep myself from coming here . This is the darkest place I know , the most quiet , the most still . It is the one place that has n't changed much . Hours literally escape me as I stare out the smudged , fogged glass panes . All I can do is reminisce , how clean and absolutely gleaming these windows once were . The entire city lives , breathes and moves on , while I sit here imagining what it would be like if I did none of those things . Everything has changed since childhood . Not just in the typical sense where a person grows and matures , learning the world is truly cruel . The world around me has literally changed form . The air feels a bit more like needles within your lungs every time you inhale . The sunlight hits you in such a way ... it feels like slowly your skin has started to boil . The nights sky has grown so dark and velvety that the streets and horizon blend into one , making stars indistinguishable from street lights . It seems each year the moon grows increasingly larger within the sky . I remember being a child and hearing news stories about elderly people reaching their 100th birthday . If I 'm incredibly lucky , I might make it to see my 50th birthday . I 'm not very lucky , though . So I break the rules . My entire family has been killed , so what do I have to continue going for ? I come back here , even though it is outside of the Modified Living Zone . I ca n't help myself . When I come back here and sit for hours I can forget all the terrible years . The war , the famine , the uninhabitable lands that are all now abandoned ... None of them exist when I sit here and let time slip by . This home is the last connection in existence to my old life . No one else ever seems to come back meaning minimal risk in getting caught , although the concern is always present in my mind . I do n't think anyone comes back because they are all dead . At 33 , I 'm one of the oldest living citizens in our MLZ . Not many question me or my intentions and just leave me be , I 'm just seen as the crazy old woman that would rather live in the Olden Days .	0.9997956156730652
Blood and entrails covered the ground . I walked amongst the carnage , resisting the urge to lick my lips . Glazing over the corpses , my sensitive eyes checked for any sign of life . But the explosive shell had annihilated the trench , and all the soldiers inside . Finally , one appeared , flailing and crying into the dirt . With my foot I rolled him onto his back , taking in the scene . His shirt was splattered red , ripped to shreds like the flesh beneath . The man was n't a man ; he was barely more than a kid . And yet , surrounded by troops far more seasoned , he was the only survivor . Luck was on his side . `` I ... I 'm not going to make it . '' Against the booming bombs and relentless gunfire , even my heightened hearing could barely make him out . I knelt before him , placing my hand against his heart . The rapid-beating drum in his chest was failing , slowing with each thump . `` I 'm not going to make it ... am I ? '' I moved my hand to his chin , tilting his head to the side . His peach-fuzzed cheek pressed into the gory mud . The mere sight of his neck riled me up , but I forced the cravings down . If I was n't careful , I 'd take too much , and leave too little . `` You will make it , '' I assured him . `` But you are n't going to like it . '' My fangs extended , and I began to feed .	0.002399477642029524
The Lord of Hell rhythmically tapped the desktop as she pondered the mystery that has haunted Hell for past two centuries . The number of souls that dwelled within Hell was reaching zero , and the flow of souls to Hell had stopped . No current statistical interpretation could explain it ; nobody in the entirety of Hell could explain it . It irked her greatly . The last time she had been so baffled was when the number of souls damned per thousand had dropped in the nineteenth century , and stayed there.At first she had sought an explanation among the myriad of churches . Then she had realized that the change came from outside the church ! It had taken a millennium , but it seemed that humanity was slowly creating its own code of ethics , rather than using the Lord of Heaven ’ s . Something she certainly would not have bet on . Had humanity had finally learned something from Job ? The population of Hell was strongly correlated to the population of Earth . This was an unshakable trend for millennia . There would always be sinners , no matter how hard the social reformers worked , due to free will . The only way to rid the world of sinners was to rid the world of free will , and to rid the world of free will was also a sin . The only thing that would change would be the characters sent to Hell . And yet this was happening ! She was infuriated that she had lost another bet to the Lord of Heaven . What was even more grating was that she had no idea how it had happened . “ Your coffee , Mistress. ” Murmured a soft voice from behind . The imbecile should be grateful she didn ’ t vaporize him for having the audacity to enter her domain without knocking , but he was too useful to be killed , especially as there were few left in Hell . Instead she absentmindedly accepted the cup . Coffee was one of the few items imported from Earth . The ingenuity of humanity lately was astonishing , compared to a millenium before ... . The cup fell to the floor , ignored as she had an epipheny . Could it be ? ! She rushed downstairs to meet the few souls in Hell that remained . At the beginning , Hell was able to deal with the damned on a face-to-face basis . Her underlings made it a sport to figure out each soul ’ s psychology in order to administer the maximum amount of pain with the least of amount of effort . Hell in this era resembled the stereotype : chains , whips , and blood . Janitors were prized more than torturers in those days . However , around the twentieth century the population of Earth exploded , and thus the population of Hell exploded . At first she had stuck with the old methods , creating a waiting list to enter Hell ( possibly the most evil thing she had ever done ) Soon she realized Soon she realized Hell would have to adapt or its job would never be done . So Hell had automated suffering . Each soul received a small cell , and the environment was designed to make the inhabitant as miserable as possible . Loud noises for long-term sleep deprivation . Several varieties of pathogens , from severe nausea to fungi inhabiting the genitals . They were hung from the ceiling by their thumbs . They were nude . The worst was probably the perennial solitary confinement . Some of the mind games her underlings thought of disturbed even her . For the first time in centuries there was a devil in the same room as a human . To the Lord of Hell ’ s amusement , he looked pleased to see another face . That pleasure didn ’ t last , as the only thing she did before leaving was tear an arm off . Her hunch had been right . What had once been a being made of flesh , bone , and organs was now of metal , wires , and computers . She was torn between hysterical laughter and abject rage . For now she knew why the flow of souls to Hell had ceased . The dichotomy of Heaven and Hell only existed as long as humanity was born from the Hand of God . As they were now of metal rather than dust , Hell no longer had a grip on their souls . Humanity had found a way to opt out of the latest bet between God and Satan . Just as God had predicted . Dammit . At least she had a way to get back at the bastard . Around the world , the following message was heard : `` We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty . Congratulations Humanity , you have thwarted a game between Gods. ``	0.9999134540557861
Groggily I woke . Being a Saturday , my favorite day , I drug myself out of bed to the bathroom for my normal morning routine , which I referred to as 'SSS ' . After my daily drill , while I get dressed , I spot a small light flickering on my phone . I get excited as I had not seen my girlfriend for four months due to her being over seas for work . I stumble as I fall over with only one pant leg on as reach for my phone . Laying on the ground , I manage to wake my phone to see it is not Stephanie . Dejectedly , I check the message , to find a number I do not recognize , my phone tells me it is from Arizona . I read the messages , see a picture of me , lying right where I am , how I am , and get a little concerned , then I read one word . `` Run . '' I oblige . I run to my basement , calling 911 in the process . Hurriedly , I report what has happened to the operator , who calmly reassures me that there are multiple units in route . I respond to her that should anyone without proper law enforcement identification try to enter my home , I shall exercise the castle doctrine . I then hang up , and ready myself . All cunning in the world wo n't stop me from defending myself .	0.9999954700469971
Dear Ms. Lianne , You are very beautiful . Your cousin , my friend , always said it , but she could not have described the way your curly brown hair falls in front of your radiant eyes . I am fifth in line for the Nigerian throne , and I wish to see you someday . I have started to make a trust fund so that i can visit you someday , and if you could donate to it ( even just a little ) it would help my dream become glorious reality . Love , Achike Abasad , Prince of Nigeria I was furious when I received the email . I had just posted a picture on my Facebook page of my cousin and I together at a beach in California . This `` Prince '' , this scammer , had clearly been looking through my personal page and tried to use my cousin against me , staining my memory of the beautiful California sun on my back . Had he *really* thought that I would n't ask my cousin before I gave him *any* money ? So though my better judgement advised against extending the interaction , I sent him an angry email in return . He responded . Ms. Lianne , You have discovered me . I am a poor scammer working out of a crumbling office in Nigeria , and the only way I could contact you was through a scam . However , my feelings towards you , my longing to meet you , were all too real . You are a symbol of the love I have never gotten , the luxury I have been denied . Please let me video message you during work . It is strictly forbidden , but it is the only way I can think of to convince you of my good intentions . Love , Achike Abasad , Email Scammer Before I continue , I should tell you that I am an exquisitely lonely person . I inherited my wealth . I fill my time ordering from the pages of Skymall and ladies ' magazines . To find interest in me outside of my money or familial connections was intriguing , and the invitation was too good to ignore . I turned on the computer and submitted an invitation to talk through our webcams . He accepted immediately . I saw a set of crooked white teeth smiling before he leaned back from the camera and allowed me to see his whole face . His cheeks were hollow and concave and his hair was lank , but despite this I could see the seeds of attraction . He opened his mouth to speak , but before he did , a nasal voice spoke in heavily accented English from the background . `` You have n't messaged the rich woman yet ? You always were the best in the business , Achike . Having the smart to sell her that love symbol garbage- inspired . Really . Inspired . '' Achike 's face grew more tight with every word . His face flashed with anger as he stared at a location offscreen , only to disappear to a mask of panic . `` It is n't true ! '' Achike said . `` Is just what I told the boss ! The love is true ! Is- '' I closed my laptop with a slam like a gunshot . It really had sounded a lot like a gunshot . My imagination had taken another victim .	0.9999955892562866
`` No , sah . Not here . '' Frowning , I glanced over at Attenib . I 'd heard a wobble in the man 's voice that I did n't recognize . He did n't sound quite like himself . `` Atten , everything okay ? '' I asked in a lowered tone , taking a step closer to him . Damnable insects swooped down at my face , biting and stinging . I managed to smack one , and watched with vicious satisfaction as it slammed into a nearby tree trunk and then dropped , stunned , to the forest floor . I returned my attention back to my guide . After years alongside Attenib , I knew his moods well , recognized the minor twitches of the muscles beneath his nut-brown skin . I 'd worked with him long enough to trust in his uncanny ability to know just where to dig . But now , today , he looked nervous , pale despite his leathery , tanned hide . And when he looked back at me , I saw a glint of unexpected emotion in his eyes . Fear . `` Is this the wrong place to dig ? '' I asked again . I stood near him , almost shoulder to shoulder despite the oppressive , humid heat of the jungle . I 'd called a halt , so our porters huddled several steps behind , taking shelter in the shade of a large palm . Again , Attenib shook his head . `` Right place , '' he said softly . `` But wrong feeling . Not good to dig here . '' I took a moment to weigh his words . I truly believed that Attenib appreciated our arrangement , that he harbored no resentment towards my ownership of him . After all , I 'd treated him far better than his fellows , snapped up on the bidding block to work the fields until their muscles and bodies failed them . But I 'd seen his talent , and he 'd served me well . But we sat on our laurels too long , as I basked in the attention of the Royal Society and failed to note the new naturalists nipping at my heels . I 'd secured the funding for this expedition , but one of the Senior Fellows had drawn me aside and warned me that , without results , it would be my last . I looked again at Attenib . Did he know the conflict in my head ? He just looked back , waiting . I made my decision . `` Men ! Gather your tools ! '' I shouted to the hired porters . `` You lot ! Axes , to clear the area ! You others , picks and shovels ! This is the spot ! '' Attenib said nothing , but I saw him shrink back towards the camp . I should have disciplined him , I knew , but I chose to let him go . I had a dig to supervise . And soon , Attenib 's almost supernatural talent proved itself once again , as one of the porters let out a cry of surprise . `` Sah ! Over here ! '' I hurried over to the man , roughly pushing him aside before he could damage the delicate artifact . But my words died away as I stared , open mouthed , at the object . Silver metal , curved , suggesting a large cylinder . Rivets in regular lines showed where the plates were anchored together . A hatch , the glass obscured with dust and dirt . And a logo of some sort , a square of blue with white dots , next to red and white stripes . It looked like a flag , albeit one I 'd never seen before . `` What is it ? '' I asked , utterly confused . From nearby , Attenib let out another soft moan . `` Evil , '' he answered me . `` Not from this place . It does n't belong . '' I bent closer , wiping away more dirt . I saw words , now , stamped on the metal . `` Apollo , '' I read . `` What could that be ? '' Unnoticed , Attenib shrank back , in amid the trees that reminded him of his childhood when he 'd laughed and run between their trunks . His master continued to puzzle over the alien thing that he 'd felt in the ground , but Attenib could stand here no longer . With other objects , he felt their history . That drew him to those hidden beneath the earth , feeling for their long histories , disrupted but to be resumed once unearthed . It became almost beyond notice , the history of all around him , all he touched . But this object had no history at all .

It was all like becoming conscious during a dream or something . There I stood -- all of a sudden , without arriving , just there -- in the middle of what looked like a crowded outdoor mall around Christmas . Only , there were no decorations , it was just crowded . filled with regular people doing regular things . `` Welcome to Heck . '' He said unenthusiastically while looking at the long line for the apple store . `` what ? '' `` Welcome to heck . You 're new here , you got that orange sticker on your name tag . '' he said pointing out the apparent name tag i had on my flannel shirt . `` What ? '' `` Im Darren , nice to meet you . I know they make you wear that for the first couple of days you arrive . So what do you think of the place ? '' He asked with a sarcastic smile , the same kind of smile you get from someone who sees you shoveling snow and makes a weather joke . `` the fuck is heck ! ? `` Oh shit , your like new-new here , like just now new . Listen man , I 'm honored to be the one to tell you this . You died , this is Heck . Like , not Heaven . not Hell , but like Heck , you know . Just Heck . '' `` I 'm dead ? '' I said with an air of confusion . `` Where 's the white pearly gates or the guy who 's supposed to read off my naughty and nice list ? Is n't there supposed to be a guy ? '' `` No Guy , common man , its 2016 . They got computers for that shit now . '' Darren said with a smile . `` Listen , I do n't have all day to explain this to you cause i got to get in line for the new iPhone 7 , that shit is sweet , but because your new here , I'ma give you the basics . Heck is a place you go when you die . Yes , Heaven is real , Yes Hell is real , but those are like for the goodie-goodies and the real bad mother fuckers . Heck is more in between . More like Earth-light . Like , you cant die again so that 's cool , but like you 're kinda stuck here for eternity . It ai n't all bad though , wifi is cheap , rent is reasonab ... '' `` Wait , wait wait ! '' I pouted off interrupting him mid sentence . `` Wifi ? rent ? you have to pay rent when your dead ? '' `` Oh yeah bruh , rent , wifi , water , gas , utilities , taxes . But do n't worry , the employment office will find you a job that pays pretty good . Plus the housing office will probably get you into a house by the end of the week . Trust me dude , its not that bad . Its Middle Management . Heck is the Middle Management of the Heavens with no possibility of upward mobility . Middle Management Bro ! ''	0.9999955892562866
Frodo had never been on a ship this big before . He 'd certainly never been on the bulbous bridge of an elven capital ship , with towering synthglass panels on all sides curving up impossibly and meeting a hundred feet above his head . The view out the front of the bridge made his stomach pinch . There they were : the Pillars of Creation , close enough to fill his entire field of view , gold and fluffy and immeasurably , unbearably huge . `` It is a gift ! '' shouted Boromir , the headstrong eldest son of Gondor 's king . `` A gift to the foes of Mordor . Why not use this ring ? '' Frodo eyed the ring . It sat , gleaming dully , atop the plinth in the center of the bridge where he 'd placed it a minute ago . Releasing it from his possession had left him with the most queasy feeling , his bones transformed to rubber . `` You can not wield it , '' said Aragorn , sitting back , still wrapped in the Star Ranger 's dark green coat that accompanied him everywhere . `` None of us can . The Ring answers to Sauron alone . '' Frodo would have sworn that the ring shone brighter for a moment when Aragorn pronounced its master 's name . Ah , Space Christ . This was no place for a hobbit . Frodo 's people were wayfarers , nomads . Life in zero G had left them smaller and more compact than these towering land-dwelling specimens . A hobbit 's bones were short and stout , though not as thick or durable as a dwarf 's . It was an excess of gravity that led to the stocky stature of the dwarves , who made their living excavating deep beneath the surface of dense metal planets . It was the dwarves , thought Frodo , with whom he identified most closely . Simple , proud people who made an honest living , without any of the high-tech dalliances of the elves , or the unblinking arrogance of the pure-humans . If you 'd told Frodo two weeks ago that he would be here , right now , his mates Sam and Merry and Pippin taking a tour of the engine room , and him standing on the bridge himself , surrounded by the galaxy 's most important people -- he would have told you to shove it up your exhaust pipe . Their ship had barely made it from the Shire in one piece , hounded as they were by the silent black frigates that Gandalf said were piloted by Sauron 's top commanders . If not for the assistance of Aragorn , who 'd guided them from jump point to jump point in his muted silver corsair Anduril , and even fended off the Black Riders alone for a few minutes while Frodo and the others dealt with an overheated hyperdrive , they would be nothing but molecules floating , miles apart , through the dead , empty vacuum . What brought Frodo 's attention back to the discussion at hand was the sudden movement of Gimli , one of the dwarves , who lunged out of his seat , violet light-axe crackling to life , and brought the sizzling blade down on the ring with all the force his burly arms could muster . There was a searing screech , and a crack , as the light-axe scoured a deep rut into the plinth . The ring , struck full force , simply scooted a few inches to the side and arrested itself . `` Oh , great , '' said Legolas , the snootiest elf Frodo had ever met . `` Typical dwarf . '' Before Gimli could respond , Elrond rose to his feet , extending a hand that silenced everyone at once . `` The Ring can not be destroyed , Gimli , son of Gloin , by any craft that we here possess , '' said Elrond , his voice assuming a supremely patronizing tone that Frodo prayed was unintentional . `` The Ring , '' continued Elrond , `` was made in the fires of the galaxy 's core . Only there can it be unmade . It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the supermassive black hole from whence it came . '' Acrid smoke rose up from the ruined plinth 's black gash . The smell -- like an overclocked supercomputer thinking itself to death -- seemed out of place on the glittering bridge . `` One of you , '' said Elrond , `` must do this . '' The words hung in the air , fat and unpleasant . `` One does not simply fly into Mordor , '' said Boromir after a while . `` Its systems are guarded by more than just orcs . There is evil there that does not sleep , and the great eye is ever watchful . It 's a barren wasteland , riddled with fire and ash and dust . Not with a fleet of ten thousand carriers could you do this . '' `` Did you hear nothing Lord Elrond said ? '' shouted Legolas , leaping to his feet , his long blond hair billowing . `` The Ring must be destroyed ! '' `` And I suppose you think you 're the one to do it , '' said Gimli . In a flash they were all bickering , even Gandalf , who Frodo had never taken for the argumentative type . Normally Frodo would have enjoyed this -- not every day did the highest and mightiest dwellers of the universe embarrass themselves in front of a humble Hobbit -- but for some reason he 'd developed a thrumming , red-hot headache . After a while their shouts and sneers became too much for him to stand . `` Ah , fuck , '' he shouted , `` I 'll take the damn thing . '' Everyone stopped -- Legolas even left his mouth hanging open mid-insult -- and stared at him . `` The condition is that you all have to shut up , though , '' grumbled Frodo .	0.9999959468841553
`` Yeah , like it would stop me . PVC panes and styrofoam . But let 's not waste the door just yet . I 'll call my landlord . '' I dial the number . `` Yo , Dreamer [ we 're on nickname basis ] , could you get a spare key and let me out ? Seems the lock is jammed . '' `` Okay , be right there ! '' I sit on my bed . A minute later the phone rings . It 's him . `` Funny , my lock is stuck too . '' `` Okay , I can get out but the door will need to be fixed afterwards . '' `` Sure thing , it 's not like we have much choice . The door is crap anyway , it was long due to be replaced . Could you check my door when you 're out ? Maybe some asshole poured glue into the locks everywhere ? '' The panes take a couple kicks and in seconds I have a sizable hole in the door . I walk to the landlord through the empty staircase , crouch by his door . The lock seems to be okay . I knock . No reply , silence . I press the door handle . Wo n't budge . `` Hey , '' I shout through the door . `` You there ? '' I knock a few times . My phone rings . Him again . `` Did you get out ? '' `` Yeah , I 'm standing in front of your door , did n't you hear my knocking and shouting ? '' `` Not a peep . Wait ... '' I hear loud thuds over the phone . `` Did you hear that ? '' `` What did you hit ? Where are you ? I just heard it over the phone ! '' `` I was hitting my door ! '' I hit the door with my fist . `` Beating on your door . '' `` Shit . It 's not funny . '' I start double checking if I 'm at the right door . No way , it ca n't be any different . `` Wait , hold on , somebody 's calling me '' , he says , then he hangs up . I wait a minute . Ringtone . `` shit , something 's fucked up a lot . Pat called me , saying that she ca n't get out . From our apartment . Right here , this one . She 's not here . She says she 's standing right in front of the door . Right where I am standing . We did a test , checked the wardrobe , telling each other what we see . Everything matches except of things we do . Like , I open the bathroom door , she says the bathroom door is closed . What now ? '' Sudden thud , explosion , loud distant noise . `` Did you hear that ? '' `` I saw that ! An airplane just crashed into a building a couple blocks away ! '' `` Shit , shit , shit . '' `` One good thing , probably there was nobody on board ... '' `` No shit . Wait , I got a text . Call you in a moment . '' I turned back to my flat with ruined door . The phone rang . Dreamer again . `` Just got a text from Raki . Go to Reddit , open the thread about locked door if you want to live . There 's a bunch of advice how to get out if one is locked out , and then you 'll have a bunch of nuclear power plants all over the world to shut down before they melt down on their own . People are pooling all they know about stuff that can go wrong , everyone 's in an individual universe , every single person must save their own world by themselves . ''	0.9999955892562866
Harold wrapped the cloak of blackness around him like a familiar coat . He could feel the rope tighten like a firm hand around his throat . He had not lived a good or happy life . His mother Margaret had just been the product of a sad cycle , he couldn ’ t blame her without also blaming himself . She hadn ’ t chosen to be the victim of child abuse or the domino effect it would have on the rest of her life . Maybe she could have overcome it , been stronger and not passed that abuse down another generation , but maybe she couldn ’ t have . Harold knew what he was , always would be . He could feel his mother ’ s weakness inside him . He had never considered himself very brave , very strong or very smart . In his optimistic moments he thought it was just the abuse talking , but Harold had always been more of a pessimist . He knew he was just like her , he was so full of hate and anger , with a temper that was as violent as it was unpredictable . There was only one real way to break the cycle . School had been a place of misery , he couldn ’ t help but get into fights . He did n't fit in , and was always on the outside , his rage would leak out on the few unfortunate children who had taken the bullying too far . Suspension and expulsion , had become a revolving door of punishment , but had done nothing to help Harold . Each one only leading to a new and more brutal beating at home . The blows would come from the darkness , her foot steps silent on the thick carpet , the pain always coming from a new direction . She had been blind long enough to know exactly how to make sight an undefeatable advantage . So all he could do was wait for it to end , and then clean up the mess . It didn ’ t get easier as he got older , as others his age started to see . His highschool had advanced sight courses , you ’ d learned how important it was to see at an early age . They ’ d quote statistics that strongly correlated “ age at sight development ” with all sorts of positive life developments , they didn ’ t mention the statistics for the late bloomers , but the worst was always implied . And of course the first thing you ’ d hear from a kid once they could see was the long list of things blind people had never done . There had never been a blind , president or Senator . None of the famous sport stars were blind , and none of truly famous and loved Actors had ever been blind . There had of course been a few successful scientist that has made it through the various blind purges in history , and others that had made their mark , but there had always been an unspoken ugliness that followed these people , a scar on their legacy unfaded by the generations . As more kids transitioned into the world of the sighted , Harold could feel himself gradually transitioning from the majority into the minority . Life would never get to be easy for him . In highschool he was at least one of many , in college he was one of few . As an adult being blind was something to stay away from , a sign of human malfunction . Nobody ever asked if it had been a choice , a fear that kept him blind , everyone just assumed it wasn ’ t . Looking back now , the feeling disappearing from his limbs as the blood makes one final push to protect his vital organs , a gentle coldness creeping in from the darkness , he ca n't help but feel a sharp twist of regret as he remembered the one girl who he had given sight to .	0.000583929882850498
`` Mo . '' I rub my eyes with my hand . `` It 's four in the morning . You have not teleported . It 's just a dream . '' The line crackled as Mo let out an exasperated sigh . `` No , Becks . That 's the thing . It 's actually real ! '' `` Okay . '' In my half-waking state , I was willing to humor her . `` Tell me what happened , then . How did you finally manage to crack this code ? '' `` Well , you know how I 've been trying to get to the park bench for a while now ? '' *A while ? Try four years . * I bit back the sarcastic comment . `` Yes . '' `` Since that 's been a total bust so far , I decided I should try out different locations . I thought , maybe the issue is n't that I 'm trying to go to far . Maybe it 's that I 'm not going far *enough . * '' `` What ? '' I sat up in bed . `` What are you talking about ? '' Mo giggled . `` Guess where I am right now . '' `` Paris ? I do n't know . '' `` Nope . '' She sounded so giddy . It was really throwing me . `` I 'm in ... '' She cut herself off with another laugh . `` The outer stratosphere . '' I hesitated . `` You ... what ? '' `` I 'm almost up in space . '' A breeze rushed by , causing a ripple of static . `` Oh man , I think I 'm going to try for the moon . '' I froze . `` The moon ? '' `` Would n't that be *crazy ? `` * `` Do n't do it ! '' I blurted out . Mo paused . `` What ? '' `` Um ... '' Inspiration hit me . `` I mean , do n't do it *yet . * Could you , uh , FaceTime me ? Right now ? I want to see the view from up where you are . '' `` Oh ! Sure . Hold on . '' The line went silent for a moment . I chewed my knuckle , heart racing . *Come on , * I prayed . *Call back . Come on . * Finally , my phone rang again . I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw that it was indeed a FaceTime request from Mo 's number . I hit ACCEPT , and Mo 's face appeared on my screen . `` Hi ! '' she exclaimed . Her brown eyes shifted back and forth quickly , and her short hair was a mess of tangled clumps . There were wrinkles at the edges of her lips , and dark circles underneath her eyes . She reminded me of a rabid animal . `` Here you go ! Take a look ! '' She held the phone away from her and spun around in a slow circle . `` Is n't it amazing ? '' `` It is , '' I agreed , scrutinizing the view as best as I could . In a few seconds I realized that she was downtown , at the top of the Hilton . The very top . The roof . `` I 'm very impressed , '' I told her . `` I got ta go . '' She brought the phone back to her face . `` I 'm gon na try for the moon . '' `` *No ! `` * I exclaimed . `` Um . Can you wait one second ? I want to ... show you something before you go . '' `` Oh . '' Mo seemed surprised . `` Okay . Where is it ? '' `` I have to hang up and get it . Can I call you back ? '' `` Sure ! '' Even with the delay in her plans , she was still beyond excited . `` Do n't take too long ! '' I hung up and quickly dialed Rei 's number . To my relief , she picked up . `` It 's four in the morning , '' she snapped by way of greeting . `` Rei , it 's time , '' I told her . `` We need to get Mo some help . ''	0.9999719858169556
The spacecraft hummed with the noises of equipment and the low hiss of pressurized air . A single seat was in the cockpit , an astronaut strapped in with harness tight . His helmet rested on his chest as he lay facing the stars above the rocket . He calmed his breathing , ready for the command to initiate launch . The waiting was long and the pressurized fuel beneath him was poised ready to erupt and launch him into the sky . `` Ground Control to Major Tom . Ground Control to Major Tom . '' Astronaut Tom Rorsen snapped from his reverie . He reached an awkwardly gloved hand to the switch nearby and activated the radio . `` Major Tom , go ahead . '' The radio buzzed for a moment with static before speaking once more . `` Take your protein pills and put your helmet on . '' `` 10-4 , Control . '' He felt for the small tinfoil package and ripped it open revealing two small , brown pills . He threw them to the back of his mouth and swallowed them down a dry throat . His helmet was heavy as he lifted it over his head and gave it a small twist , it hissed for a second as it pressurized with the suit . `` Ground Control to Major Tom . '' The radio spoke once more , and the dash panel lit with numbers . 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... `` Commencing countdown . Engines on . '' The rocket began to rumble and vibrate beneath him . 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... `` Check ignition , and may God 's love be with you . '' 2 ... 1 ... Sudden explosion sounded from below and the rocket rose from the Earth . Major Tom felt the pressure against his chest as he pushed against gravity . The lights of the panel clicked and lit in various order as boosters released and engines reignited . The altimeter continue to spin as the craft rose higher and higher into the atmosphere . Then ... the roar of the engine ceased . The click of the lights slowed , and the silence began to creep in . Major Tom 's hands rose from his lap and floated in the zero gravity . Earth lay behind him , and eternity lay before him . The rocket quietly slid through space and the stars shined bright in the eyes of Major Tom . The radio cackled to life with static . `` Ground Control to Major Tom . '' The voice sounded distant as if spoken from a tin can . `` Go ahead , Ground Control . '' `` Ground Control to Major Tom , you 've really made the grade . The papers want to know whose shirt you wear . '' Tom laughed and smiled . They 'd done it . They 'd really done it . `` Major Tom to Ground Control , you know it 's all government issue . '' The radio spoke once more . `` Tom , it 's time to the leave the capsule . If you dare . '' Major Tom looked to the circular hatches at the rear of the cockpit . Through the hatch window he could see the rounded horizon of earth and the total darkness showing beyond . He opened the first hatch and closed it behind him , only one piece of metal door separated him from the vacuum of space . He secured the tether to his harness and attached the air his to his pack . The hiss of oxygen greeted him and stabilized ; there were no leaks . He opened the hatch and eternity opened before him . He keyed his radio . `` Major Tom to Ground Control . I 'm stepping through the door . And I 'm floating in a most peculiar way . '' His feet left the deck of the ship and he was slowly drifting away . Earth shone beneath him and he slowly rotated until his view showed the moon in the distance , closer than anyone had ever been before . Around him the stars shined brighter than anyone had ever seen . `` And the stars look very different today . '' As he drifted he was suddenly struck with a deep sense of melancholy . He looked down upon the earth and all of its inhabitants busy with their lives , and he was all alone . `` For here , am I sitting in my tin can . Far above the world . Planet Earth is blue , and there 's nothing I can do . '' He reeled back into the ship and sealed the hatch . He watched as the earth slowly receded from view as his vessel sped through the dark sky with amazing speed . He saw the moon slide into view beneath him . Soon , it too was receding behind as his vessel left earth orbit . He calmed his breathing as he looked forward into the brilliant sky ablaze with distant stars . He keyed the radio and spoke once more . `` Major Tom to Ground Control . '' There was mostly static , but Ground Control sounded from a distance . `` Go ahead , Tom . '' `` Though I 'm past one hundred thousand miles , I 'm feeling very still . And I think my spaceship knows which way to go . '' The static sounded for a minute . `` Ground Control to Major Tom , we are working hard to get you back . Stay with us , Tom . '' Major Tom keyed the radio and looked over his shoulder at the distant Earth . `` Tell my wife I love her very much . '' `` She knows , Tom . She knows . '' The ship slid on into the ocean of space , Tom at its useless controls staring into the face of eternity . `` Ground Control to Major Tom . You 're circuits dead , there 's something wrong . '' Only static . `` Can you hear me , Major Tom ? '' `` Can you hear me , Major Tom ? '' `` Can you hear me , Major Tom ? '' `` Can you- '' Major Tom smiled as the voice slid out of range , drowned in a sea of static . `` Here am I floating in my tin can . Far above the moon . Planet Earth is blue . '' He looked at the gauges of his panels and closed his eyes . `` And there 's nothing I can do . ''	0.0028391138184815645
So perfect . Standing in the kitchen , humming a tune only she knows orchestrating the rich smell of delicacies . The crackle of the fire , the sound of the wind outside , a soft chime of the bells , all seem to dance at her tune . God I love her . Words lodge in my throat and my sweat glands seem to have a life of my own every time I look at her . She sashays around the kitchen dancing on the tune she created . She looks as if she has been photoshopped in real life . Perfect hair , body face , lips , smile . Hell , her body is so impeccable that it must be chiseled by the Michelangelo himself ? I do n't know . I do n't know much about art . She does though . Oh yes , she could talk for hours about art and classical music and opera and all that . Me ? I can talk about football ... and beer . If beer is a good topic for conversation . You see , I am a regular Joe . Probably competing for the most boring person title . I wake up , work , come back , watch television , drool over for my wife , sleep , rinse and repeat . Nothing spectacular . Except the gem of a wife god knows how I managed to score . The train of my thought must have reached a destination beyond this dimension because it took my wife some shaking me to crash me down to this world . 'Down to earth bozo ! What are you thinking ? ! '' * '' What can I possibly think about ? Come here ! `` * I grabbed her waist and brought her down to my lap . Her lips turned to express mortification but her eyes gave her away . `` What are doing ? Stop being a caveman bozo ! '' She could n't complete the rest because I proceeded to kiss her . Fuck . The warmth of her skin melted into my soul and threatened to burn me . This is it . End me now as a happy man . Perfect . Did I say that ? My wife has a habit of sleeping early . And I know it 's going to sound weird but we sleep in different rooms as well . Maybe a lot of couples do this but once I made a mistake of sharing this with a friend and boy did I never heard the end of it . `` She 's using you . `` , `` She must be cheating with someone , '' `` She 's weird . Break up with her ' . No thanks . Initially even I thought it was weird but our sex life is hot and she is 11 on a scale of 10 , so who am I to complain ? So here I am dozing off on the sofa trying to watch some shit show on the TV . I am almost asleep but the dull thud of the clock as the time turns 10 breaks through the fabric of my dreams . My reverie 's broken , my veins are filled with a newfound zeal and lively sweat glands are back . `` Hey . '' She 's here . Now this is the part where logic escapes me . And I let it . Standing in front of me is a woman who makes my heart beat in a rhythm possibly impossible for a human being . And she 's not my wife . In fact she is opposite of my wife . She has unruly hair , a freckled face with signs of past pimple breakouts , and a very ... normal body . Like she has tummy fat and heftier thighs , unshaved legs and her own body smell . Just like magic she comes every night and disappears like magic in the morning . At first I used to get alarmed and thought about calling the police . But maybe it was something in her voice , or the loneliness that lurked in her eyes that stopped me from doing that . * '' Hi'* `` May I join you ? What are you watching ? '' * '' Eh nothing . Just flipping through channels '' * `` Mind if i join you ? '' * '' Yeah no problem'* I scoot over to the furtherest side of the couch , away from her presence . She is clouding my mind already . But no avail . Soon we got to talking . And that talking evolved to laughing , teasing and munching popcorn . She was snuggling up to me , her face towards me beckoning me to kiss her . Her smell was n't helping at all . This is wrong ! My goddess is lying in the next room . Next room ! And here I am sitting with some god-knows-who strangers thinking about all the unspeakable things . I love my wife . So why does this feels so right ? So I plunged my lips and drank her . All of her . Her taste , he scent , everything . I was drowning and she was my raft . We kissed each others marks , freckles . Explored every nook , revised every secret . I reveled in her imperfections and reached heights I did not know existed . All the thought of my mind warped itself in a tight corner of my mind . Until it resurfaced again as the lady laid beside me , her breathing hurried and her eyes shut . The thoughts burst back with full vengeance and started the cogs of self loathing and misery . What kind of a man was I ? Cheating on a person I love so much . I have gone insane ! Making love to a person who might just be a product of my dream . This must be it . But the touch of her skin proved otherwise . She is real alright . And I ca n't help but draw comparisons . She looks a blemish in front of my flawless wife . But the difference is what makes her so endearing . I can talk to this person . I can reach to the depth of my soul and bare it her . Bring out those shades I did n't even know existed . Her body does not repel me , it does the exact opposite . Each freckle makes me want to kiss it . Each mark makes me want to dig out the history it hides . Each pimple or fat makes me realize how human she is . And how human I am . All my shame and conscious about my body leaves me and I feel ... content . I can write poetry about my wife . But this woman turns me into a song . I ... .love her . Is it possible to love two people at the same time ? Does that make me wrong ? I must be slipping into the wonder of my dreams . She mutters something in her sleep which caresses me like a lullaby . `` I love you bozo . '' I have heard it somewhere have n't ? Where ? But soon it does n't matter as I am lost in the realm of the night . ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Yes so this is the second time I am responding to a prompt .

`` The thing that bothers me the most are the crashes . '' As I set down my pint , I raised my eyebrow at Number 817 . `` Crashes ? '' `` Car crashes ! Like , they 're just proof of our hypocrisy . I thought once we `` all agreed '' the crashes would stop . Still fucking traffic everyday . '' He slammed his drink down for dramatic emphasis . `` Now Number 336 explain to me why- '' I know how we get , so I knew he was beyond reasoning with at this point and just needed to get it off his chest . I tried to think about something else as he ranted on . 5 years ago , everyone had voted . There was too much violence , too much division ... The only thing we all knew for certain was our world would forever be on a doomed path of war and resentment , unless a drastic change was made . The silent majority rose up to change the future and decided on another way , the Agreement . Another drunk patron whose number I could n't see had caught on to 817 's complaints and made his way over . `` I misss art , '' he slurred at us . Through secret means one person had been selected , after which everyone else would then be patterned . We became Like-Minded . Disagreement had become treason . I could hear the exchange getting more heated in the background . We know better than this , so I tried to diffuse the situation . `` We still have art- '' `` New art ! '' Our new friend interjected . `` None of us can draw . Or paint . I 'm worthless . I just thought it would be different ... I had hopes ... '' 817 had caught on . `` Yeah , we all love art , but there will never be any new art ever fucking again . Cheers to the agreement ! How was that supposed to make sense ? We are the same terrible loser now . '' The more sensible parts of Us had started to clear out of the bar . 817 was a friend , but I know he or this stranger would abandon me just the same if the roles were reversed . Any of us would . They were falling out of alignment . I had already begun to gather my things and prepare to get away when 817 caught on to what I was doing . His eyes flared at my wildly ; he looked around and realized he was going too far . He should have stopped there , but did n't . The drunk stranger even knew better , as he silently slumped back to the other side of the bar . He was shouting now . `` Who are we ? What asshole did they use to make the template ? The one that made us all the same ? Where is the fucking lazy , prideful , jealous , emotional wreck who they left the world to ? Even when we all agree we still ca n't get anything right ! '' By now the Unanimous had arrived , and with brutal efficiency 817 was silenced and removed from the bar . We all know you ca n't disagree with the Agreement . It was the first thing we all agreed on . We do n't like to dwell on things , so within moments he bar has resumed the drunken murmur that normally filled its walls . The stranger made his way towards the exit , but paused briefly at my table . `` I 'm sorry about your friend . '' `` We all know to agree , '' I replied . `` We all know things are better this way . It 's his own fault . '' The stranger gave me a sullen and terrified look as he showed me his number , before disappearing out the door . `` No ... it 's mine . '' And with that Number 1 vanished into the night .	0.9999954700469971
It had been two months since WALDO had begun processing and comparing the combined digital history of the parallel universes . Cheekily named after the character from the popular book series , WALDO was the product of months of planning by top AI engineers and data processing technicians . Using Google and local information from databanks all over the globe , WALDO would take the top 100 recurring keywords for a search in order to create a hexidecimal code to represent the profile for all events in history , famous people , biological processes , George Clooney 's internet history , foods on a stick , 1 star restaurants on Yelp , lists of medical burn centers in the United States , superhero prompts on a subreddit , and trillions of pieces of information that comprised the recorded digital collection of humanity 's understanding of the known universe . Many bottles of champagne were popped over the creation of the project and now , both parallel universes had nothing to do but wait as WALDO silently carried out its sole purpose . `` Dunnigan , where 's WALDO at ? '' Originally meant as a joke from his supervisor , the question became a source of frustration for both as days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months . Media interest had already moved on to a famous celebrity divorce , as WALDO continued its process diligently with no end in sight . `` Well , sir , same as yesterday . No change in activity levels . '' `` Alright , well let me know if anything happens , I guess . '' `` Sure thing . '' Craig Dunnigan minimized the processing usage tools that tracked WALDO 's level of activity and resumed playing Fallout 4 . `` Another Fat Man ? Come on ... '' *Beep* `` Hm ? '' Craig alt-tabbed out of the game to see that the activity readout , which had until now remained relatively constant , had taken a sharp decline in the last ten minutes . `` Walt ... WALT ! Get in here ! '' He heard the sound of chair wheels sliding , a door opening , and then running footsteps . `` What happened ? '' `` It ... appears WALDO 's finished . '' `` Alright , well where 's the anomaly ? Pull up the data . '' After a couple of clicks , Craig had pulled up the Master Sync List . `` What am I looking at ? '' `` Well , these columns are every bit of information that was processed , but in order to save space , the information that matches up exactly is compressed and categorized . So any anomalies are going to take up more space since WALDO intentionally has no process for dealing with search terms that do n't have exact keyword matches . So I just have to sort by size ... let 's give it a minute . And there it is . This code . This is the difference . '' `` Well , what is it ? '' `` It 's in the beta column which means it 's something in their world that we do n't have . WALDO is loading up relevant local files as we speak ... Damn , this is exciting ! Ok so it appears that the relevant files were n't a search term but local files . And ... they come from the United States Federal Government ! Well theirs , not ours . File source seems to be ... well ... the Department of Defense ... No , it ca n't be . They 're plans to ... Oh , God , help us . ''	0.9999957084655762
Mommy was crying again . I walked into Matty ’ s room . Matty was in his crib crying , too , but that was okay because he always cries . Mommy was in the chair and I went up to her and hugged her leg . “ Mommy , don ’ t cry , ” I said . I climbed into her lap and she hugged me , but she didn ’ t stop crying . “ I love you , ” I said . She hugged me tighter , so I patted her back . “ Do you want some water ? ” I asked . Because that ’ s what you do when people cry . “ No , ” she said . “ It ’ s okay. ” Then she laughed and hugged me more and stopped crying . “ I ’ m good because I helped you feel better , right ? ” “ Yes , you are a very good boy. ” “ Matty is bad because he made you cry again. ” “ No , ” she said . “ Matty is a baby . He cries because he has colic . He can ’ t help it. ” She picked me up and carried me out of the room . “ Why can ’ t he help it ? ” “ Because he ’ s just a baby. ” “ When I was a baby , did I cry that much ? ” Mommy smiled . “ No , ” she said . “ You were a very sweet baby. ” She pressed her nose to my nose and sniffed . I gave her a great big hug . Then she put me down and I went to play trains . Daddy didn ’ t come home until late . I was in bed . I am very sneaky . I can pretend to be asleep and fool everybody . Matty was crying again , and I heard Mommy say “ I don ’ t know if I can do this any more. ” Then she started crying again , too . I knew I had to be brave . I went out of the bed and to the closet . Then I took a deep breath . I opened the door slowly , because I was scared . “ Mumpo , ” I said . I whispered because it was night-time and I ’ m not allowed to make a lot of noise at night0time , but also because I was being sneaky . “ Come out I know you ’ re in there. ” Mumpo made a scary bump noise , but he didn ’ t come out . “ Mumpo , please. ” Mumpo has eyes he carries around with him . He can throw them if he wants to see far . He rolled one outside the closet to look at me . It went squish . “ Mumpo , I need you to take Matty away , ” I said . “ Far away , so mommy won ’ t cry any more . Take him away and make him be quiet. ” Mumpo ’ s eye looked at me . It blinked . From the back of the closet , I heard him say : “ Yes. ” [ r/robotdevilhands ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/robotdevilhands/ )	4.471092779567698e-06
MARCH 3 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , I hope my letter finds you well . This letter has been sent to confirm that my office has formally received and processed the Present ’ s letter requesting to receive periodic economic updates on the state of House of Representative ’ s latest economic stimulus bill intended to boost the United States economy and to avert recession . We have successfully formed a committee of 11 members to monitor and review its progress and to release official publications from the Federal Reserve to the press . In addition I shall , at the President ’ s request , delivery personal memos citing economic recommendations as we transition into Q2 . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— APRIL 4 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . The initial stimulus has been disseminated . It has had the initial expected effect of producing a marked rise in the rate of inflation by 2.4 % . This is due to the printing and borrowing of money needed to finance the economic stimulus in the short-run . Economic analysis committees have projected that based on Census data , National Birth rates and Retirement statistics , 688 Billion USD would be needed for 2017 Q1 - Q4 . The borrowing of this has acted to weaken the US dollar globally . This however is expected to be offset by a subsequent rise in GDP , business investment , and net exports . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— JUNE 22 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . The initial stimulus is currently in Phase 2 . As predicted higher overall national spending has led to an increase in GDP and private sector investment as younger markets tend to spend more than their older counterparts instead of saving for the future . This is acted to increase the national GDP and has lifted the strength of the dollar overseas . The Federal Reserve has also instituted a step policy by which the stimulus packages are being released in batches in order to throttle inflation and prevent a glut of money supply in the markets . There have been reports of increases in litigation as some parents attempt to hold in trust the stimulus on behalf of their children , some against their wishes . These are isolated and not expected to increase . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— SEPTEMBER 22 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . The initial stimulus is currently in Phase 3 . The overall positive effect of the stimulus has been retarded by the wealth re-distribution caused by the older-biased workforce . While the initial spending of the youth demographic acted to bolster the economy in terms of an overall rise in GDP , because of the disproportionate wealth to income ( most are outside of the workforce , unemployed , or in jobs making less that 15,000 USD per year ) , this demographic overall has not had the ability to sustain its high level of discretionary spending for any prolonged period of time . Most notably , when the stimulus package has been exhausted , the wealth returns to their older counterparts who possess the skills and knowledge to provide the good and services that the younger markets were initially paying to own and use . This older demographic is more inclined to save overall and reduce the money supply recirculating . Forecasts indicate that within a few economic periods the economy will return to its pre-stimulus state . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— DECEMBER 18 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . GDP has fallen back to pre-stimulus levels as businesses are experiencing an economic downturn due to the absence of its previously bolstering young market demographics . Businesses are selling off excess latent capital previously needed during the higher demand of the early part of the economic stimulus and instituting layoffs due to the decreased demand and production . It was the Federal Reserve ’ s policy to suggest repayment of the national deficit during the times of higher GDP which has nearly offset the borrowing for the stimulus . The Federal Reserve will be lowering interest rates in the coming months to encourage spending and prevent another recession . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— This is wholly a work of fiction and does not represent the FED or it ’ s monetary policy	0.9999947547912598
**Before you read** , * [ this ] ( http : //imgur.com/E89426n ) is an image version that has some interesting features that you just ca n't get with regular text . * Dear Father this is to tell you and everyone else at home that I dind Dessert my unit . As I have said in my last letters if they have ever got to you I been sick with bleeding at the Lungs , ever since someone spread the most pernicious rumor that I eat opium , the Dr kept giving me things to take that made me weaker and the capt says that I either have to go to the front lines which will surly Kill me for the state I am in or go to the hospital and tend to those who wer worse off than me which I donot want to do for I have been experimented on enough . I dind know what else to do and since you dind do anything to help I am running . I am headed North to Canada where I will be free from this war . Hopefully one day I will be able to I am sorry Father and Mother . I shot him . He was brought into camp , my brother a deserter . They wanted to make an example out of him , they put him out in the field and lined up to shoot him . I was one of the firing line . George tried to stop me but I believed my superiors . While our officer watched the time , Edward just kept staring at me . I held my gun and stared back . He kept clutching a piece of paper , this letter , and holding it to his chest . Reading it now , I know why he deserted , I wish I 'd read it sooner . Maybe I would still deserve to be called your son and his brother . James P. Elliott P.S . [ Pvt . George Fredrick Elliott ] ( http : //www.civilwararchive.com/LETTERS/elliott.htm ) , [ 2nd Lt. James P. Elliott ] ( http : //www.civilwararchive.com/LETTERS/jpelliott.htm ) , and [ Edward A. Elliott ] ( http : //www.soldierstudies.org/index.php ? action=soldier_profile & Soldier=89 ) were real people who volunteered to serve in the Connecticut military during the Civil War . George mustered out as an Artificer in 1864 . James continued on to reenlist until the end of the Civil War . Edward is believed to have deserted and fled to Canada . Every single speling mistake or grammar error was intentional , even if it was n't ; I followed similar patterns that the real Edward Elliott followed with his letters . Also , if I was wrong about Edward 's `` most pernicious habit '' being opium , let me know . I have n't fact checked everything , and so parts of their story I might have totally misunderstood , but that 's just the best you 're going to get for a side project .	0.9999958276748657
Did ... Did you just prompt on my favorite game series ever ? Well then ... > *Blue Moon ... You knew just what I was there for ... You heard me saying a prayer for ... someone I really could care for ... * The man with glasses and a hole in his head walked into the Tops casino and scanned the room . No sign of Benny yet . The tables were full of gamblers , diners and drinkers in various sates of mind . Sober , drunk , poor , rich , winners , losers . Thinking he 'd just need to wait for a couple of hours for Benny to show up , the spectacled mind decided to grab a drink . One of the patrons caught his eye . He was standing at the bar , nursing a whisky , and was wearing a Vault suit with various bits of metal welded to it as crude armor . He was conspicuously unarmed , like all the patrons , but the man 's expert eyes could make out the outline of a laser pistol hidden under his suit , mirroring his own 9mm in a hidden pocket of his duster . More importantly , the vault-suited man had a Pip-boy , like his own . Now that 's something you do n't see that often in the wastes . Deciding he 'd try and learn more , the spectacled man waved the waitress over for a whisky and went to stand at the bar next to the vault-suited patron . Seeing his new drinking buddy , Vault-Man turned to him with a genuine smile . `` Howdy , pardner '' , he said . `` I think that 's what you 're supposed to say in these parts . At least , that 's what that one-wheeled cowboy robot said ... '' `` Victor ? You 've met Victor ? `` Of course . Nobody who 's interesting can make it through the Mojave Wasteland without running into that delusional bag of bolts . And you look like someone interesting too . Where 'd you come from ? '' *I could n't feel any better , or I 'd be saaaaaaaaad* That was a question he 'd heard before . The answer was clear . `` The grave . You ? '' `` I could say the same . A bigger grave than yours I 'm sure , but a grave nonetheless . Who are you , then , to cheat death like it ai n't nothing ? '' `` I am ... was ... am a courier with the Mojave Express , nothing more . '' `` Ah , a Courier . I 've met another one of you on my way west . He was somethin ' . Strange detail I remember , though , he had an Old World flag on his duster ... That ring a bell ? '' `` No . '' Something had made the Courier 's skin crawl though . `` Your way west ? You come from the east then ? You with the Legion ? '' *Why do n't you do right , like some other men do ? * `` Nah , I 'm not with them . I come from farther out east , where the Legion would actually be considered progress . I did cross their territory on my way here though . '' `` You crossed Legion territory ? Alone ? '' `` Man , I come from a place where bombs from the Great War still litter the ground . The only human beings you see are either coked-out assholes like them Fiends you got there , or are destined to be enslaved , raped or eaten , not necessarily in that order . The only other people you have are nutjob power-armored zealots fighting endless armies of Super Mutants like those that have your NCR shitting themselves in the hills . I made my way through all that to get out of there . Trust me , a bunch of jumped-up tribals like the Legion were n't gon na stop me . '' The Courier was n't about to dispute that . The fire in Vault Man 's eyes was proof enough that he could , and did , do exactly what he said . It was a fire the Courier knew all too well , the kind that could drive a man to gut a Deathclaw with a rusty Ripper if it came to that . `` Anyway '' , continued Vault Man , `` what brings you out here , friend ? '' `` Unfinished business . '' `` Ah , if I had a cap everytime I heard that one ... Last guy who had unfinished business to settle was a man set on fire and thrown in a canyon . You do n't have anything like that , do you ? '' `` Not so bad . But a guy did shoot me in the head , some time ago . That 's what I 'm here for . He owns this place . '' *In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red ... Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead ... * `` What ? Your mark runs with the Chairmen ? Man , you must really want him , to run into their den like it 's nothing ... '' `` Not like it 's nothing . I do n't have a plan , I 'm making it all up as I go along . Last time I did that ... Well , last time I did that , I negotiated a hostage situation with some Great Khans , but I 'm dealing with bigger fish now . '' At that moment , the elevator doors opened and Benny walked in . The Courier had almost drawn his gun and started shooting , when he realised Benny was n't alone . Four armed guards trailed him close , SMGs at the ready . How like the chief of the Chairmen to stack the odds in his favor . The Courier turned towards Vault-Man . `` Hey , listen , you look like you can handle yourself . Wan na tag along with me for a while ? I can use the extra firepower , and there 's a bunch of caps and an introduction to Mr. House in it for you '' `` Hah , keep your caps , I 've got more money than I can spend anyway . I 've got nothing better to do though , and you look like a guy who gets in trouble often . I like trouble . And meeting Mr. House is a pretty good deal sweetener . '' `` Great . My guy just walked into the room . Let 's go . '' With hands on their guns , both men walked casually towards Benny and his goons . *Like the fellow once said , ai n't that a kick in the heaaaaaaaaaaaad ! ! *	0.9999959468841553
The clock ticked . The Creators had left . Probability and the Creators ' sciences suggested that other beings , like the Creators would one day come . The clock ticked . It was a good robot . That was the last words of the Creators : `` You 're a good robot , robot . It 's a shame we can not take you with us . But be a good companion robot and stay here . '' It had pondered those words for millenia , as the dust , and the spiders built up , its servos and mechanisms struggling to retain functionality . The clock ticked . Perhaps it should seek Creator-like beings , move and search ? But it was told to stay . The clock ticked . It heard movement , but supposed it was a rat , like many others . The Creators took many species , samples of populations , but left many indigenous species to the world they left behind . Rats , bats , insects , birds , and many more creatures were left to go wild . Perhaps they could one day become Creator-like ? The clock ticked . It hummed a tune , 'Love me Tender ' from its databanks . The sudden sound disturbed a spider and caused it to abandon its web in fright . Many years later , the spider 's descendants returned to the original spot and began a new web . The clock ticked . It heard the sound of rocks crumbling . It pondered this , but supposed geological decay was inevitable given time and exposure to the elements without maintainence . The clock ticked . It played a short glam rock song , and bobbed its head lightly . It wondered when it would hear a new musical source . Perhaps the spiders were playing a tune all along it could n't comprehend , from the twanging of their webs ? The clock ticked . The crumbling was louder . Clear sounds could be heard , as bricks and mortar were chiselled aside . Words , of an unknown language , echoed through the chamber . The clock ticked . Eventually , light pierced the chamber , glowing , and purple . Creators ? The clock ticked . They were Creator-like . Especially the one with the Sharp-LONGSWORD-damascus*unknowncomposition* # errorimpossiblefeatureerror # , although it was a little bit taller than the statistical norm for the Creators . There was one wearing leather-COW , with elongated pointed ears and a bow . There was a gigantic one with horns and tusks , that reminded it of a warthog , only Creatorlike . It had a steel axe , seemingly normal but of strange design , using post-Industrial quality but the shape of something from the Bronze Age of the Creators . And then there was the short one , also with pointed ears , and it held a smoking oak stick that was giving off anomalous readings . The clock ticked . The Creator-like beings chittered in their non-Creator but Creator-like tongue . It tried to sing 'All you need is love ' at them . Eventually , the short one clicked its fingers , and an anomalous glow glimmered , then dissipated into the air . `` Can you understand us now , robot ? '' It nodded . `` What is your function ? '' the gigantic one grunted . It sang a song of sixpence , a pocket full of rye . `` Well , that 's interesting . A Precursor Golem Bard . '' muttered the pointy eared leather one . It blinked , and glared at the pointy eared one , before looking warmly at the most Creator-like one . `` I think ... It prefers to be called a robot . It turned red when you said Golem . '' It continued looking warmly at the most Creator-like one and crooned at it softly , in agreement . The clock stopped ticking . ( ( I 'm not sure if I 'm happy with the whole 'clock is ticking as it waits for new masters ' thing . It breaks up each segment well , implying a passage of time , but it feels a bit heavy handed to me , even when I wrote it ) )	4.4822018026025034e-06
I jumped over a branch as I ran , an Arcanine following close behind me . I looked around for an escape ... it can climb , I ca n't swim ... .a cave . I turned , sprinting hard towards it and running in . The Arcanine sniffed at the entrance , but walked away . I breathed out a sigh of relief , opening my bag and pulling out a bottle of water . I sipped from it , when I heard a noise from somewhere in the cave . I froze , and looked around . In the corner was a small , shivering figure . I pulled a small , worn dagger out of my bag . It was blunt and rusted , but if I was in danger ... As I approached the figure , it lifted it 's head . It was a young trainer . He inched back into the corner , sobbing . `` Do n't hurt me ... . '' He squeaked . I put the dagger back in my bag , and knelt down next to the kid . He looked up at me . `` Hey , kid ... where are your parents ? '' I asked . He stood up , walking to the entrance of the cave . He pointed to a town burning far in the background . Oh . He turned to me . I noticed that his shoes were barely held together , and his clothes were torn and dirty . He looked at my bag . `` M-may I have some food , if you have any ? '' He asked , averting his eyes . I pulled a strip of beef jerky out of my bag , along with a water bottle . I handed them to him , and he ate the food quickly , drinking water in between bites . He smiled , thanking me . Then we heard a screech from further into the cave , and a Zubat came flying out at us . Without thinking I grabbed the kid , running out of the cave . The Zubat did n't follow , but the screeches attracted a large Charizard , who swung at us . I ran , and ran as far as I could , but I tripped , falling hard onto the ground near a pond . I stood up as the Charizard cornered the kid and I . Charizard raised his arm to swipe . `` Kid , RUN ! '' I shouted , throwing him a granola bar and water bottle from my bag . He turned , climbing onto a high ledge on the cliff near us . The Charizard roared , striking me with his arm . I fell backwards into the water , attempting to catch onto a vine ... But I failed , and plunged into the water . It filled my lungs , burning as I attempted to struggle to the surface . Everything began to fade , slowing down ... .it was so bright ... . And then there was nothing .	0.9981092214584351
Dear Constituent , As you know , My name is Guy Dedude , and I 'm the junior senator for our fine state . I 'm emailing you today to assure you that despite the fact that the Supreme Court decided to somehow completely ignore it Constitutional role and literally change legislation based on no existing Constitutional doctrine , Federal Statute , or rule of comity , it has decided to classify caffeine as a Schedule 1 drug . I know that this is troubling for many of us and I want you to rest assured that by the end of this week Congress will simply pass a bill completely legalizing it once more . Furthermore we will be seeking to revoke the appointment of several college freshmen political science students to the Supreme Court as they have clearly abused their power . If not for what just transpired , I would have thought that only a slack jawed , knuckle-dragging , mouth breathing , moron would ever have thought the Supreme Court had the power to reclassify a drug . Nevertheless , please rest assured that this preposterous ruling will be dealt with through the legislature . Warm Regards , Sen. Dedude	0.9999958276748657
`` Oh , to have you in thy arms again , to feel your skin on mine ! '' I said to my memories of her . `` Tis such an awful thing when love must end , but our end was more tragic still . '' I leaned against my window and continued my attempt at Shakespeareian sadness `` You were taken from me ! O , my love ! You were stolen ! Ripped from my caring hands and taken- '' `` God dammit it Ted ! '' My wife said , she had been listening from the bedroom door `` It was a blow-up doll - I 'm flesh and blood , you bastard ! If you want sex how bout you come to me ? '' `` Hark , does the shrew who stole you speak ? For all I hear are noisy flies ! ''	0.9999957084655762
Terrance stared in dismay at the vast expanse in front of him . Rain poured from the dark sky onto the thousand tons of fire and steel that separated him from his destination , and the only way he could survive this cruel world was to get there in the next six minutes . He glanced at his watch one more time , then peered out from where he was waiting . The immense army was still in front of him , waiting for an opportunity to strike . He needed an opening , but he could see none , and the chances of success seemed slimmer with every passing moment . He gulped nervously , knowing that the end was within sight . Suddenly , in a divine stroke of luck , there was a flash of light to his left . And in that moment , he could clearly see the course of action he must take . It was dangerous , but the alternative was damnation . A thousand futures flashed past his eyes : there , he made it perfectly , but there it all came to a sudden halt in a burst of death , and there , he did n't move at all . He shook away the moment of hesitation , and his feet began to move . A thousand explosions rang out , and he could hear the yells of his opponents as they jeered at his efforts . A cacophony of anger , struggle , and the horns of war rang out as Terrance flew toward his avenue of escape with a fury . It was a close call , but he had made it . Terrance pulled into the parking lot , and stepped out into the rain , holding an umbrella above him as he ran toward the office . He spared a glance back at the traffic that was at a standstill that he had been in only moments before . `` Barely on time , Mr. Charles . Be careful , because the next time you 're late- '' `` I know , boss . You 'll have my ass on the street . '' Terrance stared at his shoes and accepted the reprimand . `` Bear that in mind , Mr. Charles . Traffic is no excuse , as you well know . ''	1.1022869330190588e-05
At first they called her All-American Girl , before the hero she modeled herself after – the original All-American – disappeared . He was a hulk of a man , if I ever saw one , and there was never a terror he wouldn ’ t face without his fists . It used to be that he ’ d charge into battle and dominate the field . This girl ’ s not on his level but she carries her own strength . Even now , as she faces down twelve of my men , she doesn ’ t blink an eye – even though I know it must be hard for her . My men are some of the most elite you ’ ll ever meet , having come from various backgrounds of ex-militia , mercenary work or a mixture of both . She ’ s not doing that well , if I have to be honest . It probably doesn ’ t help that there are cameras on her , broadcasting this to the public at large . I ’ m looking at my cell phone and I know that this is going viral as we speak . All-American is a pretty good brawler but the men I ’ ve got are practically making mince-meat out of her . I don ’ t even think I ’ ll have to touch her . Once I ’ m done with this , I ’ m planning to fast-track my plan for national takeover . I ’ ve promised some politicians a few positions here and there to keep them mostly off my back . There ’ s some opposition in those circles too ; the ones who want to do right by their country . They won ’ t last long . In a way , I think I ’ m fighting for the same thing she ’ s fighting for – but she ’ s going about it all wrong . What America needs is someone to tell it what to do and keep it strictly in line , not some freedom-fighting cheerleader who ’ s clearly too young to see how humans fuck up everything . Am I saying I ’ m better than most humans ? Nah , I don ’ t think so – but individuality is part of the problem – this whole protection of people ’ s sense of self is just leading nowhere . What you need to do is force people into the same way of thinking , eliminate the differences and then you have the foundation for some actual peace . I ’ m not claiming to be an angel , but since I ’ m the only one doing anything about it , people are just gon na have to follow my lead . I ’ m making sure things happen for this country . No one ’ s coming to help All-American . There are a lot of stronger superheroes out there , some with actual superpowers who would put up a better fight . Most of those superheroes are worries of the past , since I took them out . See ? I have a plan . The only superheroes left really are the wannabes like All-American 2.0 or the ones who weren ’ t really much of heroes to begin with . I look down at the battle and I ’ m disappointed . All-American has taken out a good fair share of my men . I should ’ ve known better than to underestimate her . She ’ s not that impressive but there ’ s a certain resilience to her that shouldn ’ t be undermined . I often do that when it comes to her , she exudes that kind of vibe . Her costume is bloodied . As I descend a nearby staircase , I remained cloaked in shadows as I watch her attempt to take on five men at once . “ Stop ! ” I yell , pulling out a revolver . My bullet will hit right in between the eyes of All-American and I ’ m pretty sure of it . I ’ m a good shot . “ Some men you are . Can ’ t even take out Taylor Swift playing dress up , ” I smirk . My men are annoyed , but I don ’ t care . Shame is a useful weapon when it comes to teaching and I can not afford to welcome the next do-gooder with a display like this . I might not be there to deal with the next one . All-American flips towards me , I guess in some attempt to kick the gun out of my grip . I use my free hand to grab one of her legs and smack her into a nearby pillar . She cries out in agony as she hits the ground , but I grab her by the neck pressing her up to the pillar . “ Why are you doing this ? ” she asks , and a tear is actually streaming down her face . “ For a better America. ” “ You can ’ t honestly believe that , ” she says . “ You ’ re everything that America doesn ’ t stand for . Your whole manifesto is basically mind control , it ’ s taking away everything that makes a person an actual person . How can you even look yourself in the mirror and call yourself the Patriot ? ” That ’ s what I call myself : the Patriot . “ How can you do it ? We ’ re fighting for a better America , I ’ m fighting for my future . You can stop this , Patriot . They say you used to be good , that you used to be one of us . If you really were , you ’ d stop this now . You ’ d stop. ” She ’ s right when she says I used to be one of them . She doesn ’ t know how right she is . I press my gun to her temple . “ This is the only way America can have a future . This is the only way America can be a place of peace , a good place for the future . People like you , with your wild ideas of freedom and creativity will always be a threat to the norms of society . People like you will always be what ’ s wrong with America . People like you bring change that can not be regulated . What the world needs now is order – not your brand of do-gooder chaos. ” ’ I used to share the same dream she did . I used to think that by fighting for freedom , I was doing America a favor . I used to be just as All-American as she says she is . I used to be just like her until a group of people cornered the love of my life on a lonely road on a winter night and took a slugger to his skull . I used to think that fighting for America meant something – until I saw that there will always be differences that create chaos . So I will forge a better America with my own hands . I pull the trigger and rip off her mask . And the dream she has , the dream she thinks is worth something dies with her . And as she dies , I look into her eyes and I recognize her green eyes , her blonde hair . A face I ’ ve seen a thousand times . Hayley Morris , my late fiancé ’ s younger sister . Once a promising MIT student , now a crime fighter . I don ’ t remove my mask . I don ’ t let her know who I am . I used to be All-American . I used to feel All-American . Now I feel like no one .	0.9998792409896851
It was about noon in my dunghole of an office when it happened . I had just loosened my tie and drawn my state-issued dagger given to interpreters of the law , and my underpaid intern ( whom which I had no idea why she bothered to stick around ) had equipped her shoes in her hand , the two of us cornering a fairly large basilisk-cockroach , when someone opened the door . I looked up at the door in surprise , as normally criminals tended to want to pay off the crown or take the axe , and the basilisk-cockroach grasped the opportunity and slithered away into the gap between tables . My intern lunged for it , with a large smack hit the floor and continued to slide until her head hit the end of one of the tables , all the while I gazed at the figure stepping in from the dusty blue-gray sunlight . `` Royal State Lawyer Isiah Joneson ? '' asked the man that I now recogized as a baliff sent by the upper levels of our uncaring government , recogized mostly by the obvious gilded trims on his jacket . I sheathed my cheap ceremonial dagger at my side and hastily fixed my tie as I approached the man . `` Present , '' I replied . `` Ah , '' he began , `` Fantastic . The Royal Court has appointed you the lawyer of a new defendant . '' He thrust what I assumed was a summons to me , rolled and sealed with red wax stamped with the royal seal . `` Under penalty of losing the powers bestowed to you by the Royal Court , you are obligated to- '' `` Yes , yes , you do n't have to recite the whole damned thing . '' I waved irritably at him , but he seemed relieved . He bowed stiffly , as apparently a man living in a basilisk-cockroach dump of a stone-bricked office was officially higher rank than a decorated man that walked the streets with paudrons of gold thread . `` The Royal Court appreciates your service , '' he said stiffly . And then he was gone , back out into the dusty blue-grey sunlight outside . My intern stood up shakily , holding onto the table for balance , and brushing a loose hair back behind her ear . `` What is it this time , '' she inquired , `` Another smart-mouthed treasonist ? '' `` I hope not , '' I breathed as I slid over to my desk to look for my letter opener . Unable to find it , I drew my knife ( which by the way should never be used in any of the ways I have used it thus far ) and cut the wax seal in half . `` Ah , '' I said , beginning to read the parchment as I unrolled it . `` It seems we shall be representing a smart-mouthed dragon instead . '' Today was looking up . -- -- `` Now Mister- '' `` Drop the mistur . Druk , I prefer . '' The dragon 's voice shook the fireproof , scratchproof , shatterproof , smashproof , and generally dragonproof ( though strangely not musketproof so I heard ) sheet of glass that separated us . The voice of the dragon carried through the glass , but I held a phone with my shoulder as I scrambled through my notes and papers of ancients laws that my intern had helped prepare . Truthfully , the dragon was a much better student of the law than I , having been present when it was made , but it seemed the Royal Court outlawed self-representation in front of a judge . As it was , I was to represent this dragon and try to make a case for him . `` Druk , then . You 've been accused of hundreds of accounts of manslaughter , more cases of assault , '' I paused at one of the claimes , `` Apparently a single case of sexual harassment - '' `` I will admit to that one , '' Druk huffed with a swirl of smoke . I looked up at him , and it very definitely seemed like he was smiling . `` Anyways , those and the unfathamable amount of property damage . '' `` Ever hear of insurance fraud ? '' he huffed with another rumble . My quill tipped over with the shaking . I quickly snatched it back up before it splotched over all my notes . `` Well , regardless , I do n't see a way to dismiss all the charges or get you out of this . '' I sighed as I adjusted my tie and switched shoulders for the phone . `` Some of the murders I can get you off of by using the Vigilante Ruling of 812 , which will get you about a month of prison for offense , but these are human lives here . '' I put my notes down and locked eyes with him . His huge reptilian eyes squinted back at me . `` We could use an insanity defense , but I ca n't in good conscience let you fly free , not when you 're accused of taking this many lives . '' `` No . '' I recoiled in my uncomfortable dungeon chair . `` What no ? '' `` I did not do any of it , '' was the rumbled snarl , accompanied with a spot of flame . I sat in disbelief at what I was hearing . `` Could you repeat that for me ? '' I asked meekly . `` I am innocent of it all , and I can prove it . '' -- -- The first day at the Royal Court , I found myself a nervous wreck in the washroom . There were crews of newscasters with their live cameras and crystal balls all trying to push into the building , trying to get a piece of the best scoop of the century . It was cacophonaic chaos . My intern was busy going through some final notes with the dragon . It had been a very busy few weeks , leading up to this heartpounding moment , but the quiet of the washroom calmed me . I splashed more water into my face . `` You can do this , '' I confidently assured the face in the mirror . I stood up and attempted to fix my tie again . Satisfied , I turned and found myself face-to-face with a member of the royam family , whom I had n't noticed come in . `` Prince Tyran ! '' I nearly screamed . He smiled back at me as he took off his gloves . `` Isiah . Hello . '' He smiled . `` Quite the event today for you , is n't it ? '' I did n't like his smooth voice . `` What do you want , milord ? '' I tried to ask kindly . `` Oh , to the point . I do suppose , yes , you are short on time . '' He glanced to the door . `` Well , I shalll make this short . '' Like a whirling whirlstorm , he spun his sword out of sheath and to my neck , pushing me against the wall . `` The dragon is not to win . '' He hissed . `` You understand ? That dragon does not win , and I will not touch your life - or your intern 's . '' I pushed him off and carefully pulled the tip of his sword away . `` His name is Druk , '' I stated as I fixed my tie again , pushing out of the lixurious washroom into the mess of noise outside . -- -- I fingered the hilt of my dagger absently . Druk and my intern sat behind me expectantly . Druk somehow managed a subtle nod , something that I had thought previously impossible . I turned back to face the Royal Court seated high above me . At the forefront sat the Queen , her King seated to her right . Far to my left sat the Prince who had threatened me moments ago . His face had a gentle smile . I flashed him a small grin , and watched his face slowly turn to pure horror . I began . `` Your Grace , I will show to the Royal Court that , undoubtedly , my client , the dragon known as Druk , is completely innocent of all his crimes and without fault - '' The room exploded before I could finish . I continued , yelling above the excited talking . `` -Without fault for the crimes of the murder of two-thousand and ninety two citizens , without fault for the assault of seventeen-thousand and fourty citizens , without fault for the destruction of countless amounts of property across our fair kingdom , and that he has been in fact grossly misrepresented and slandered by the media , ( especially in the case of the hooker from the Capitol ) and that none of these acts were caused by him ! Rather ! I will prove to you that my client has been framed for these crimes ! '' The room was at a deafening volume at that . The prosecution asked the Royal Court that we would ajourn for the day . They granted the request .	0.9999946355819702
Who remembers their blood type anyway ? This question was plastered on the back of Jane 's mind as she arrived at her first college class that day , like the street tag on the local Applebees that refused to fade . What did *bubblesnot* mean anyway ? Jane was n't particularly excited for her English 101 class that day anyway , and this disinterest just allowed her creeping thoughts more room to establish a semi-permanent residence in her psyche . She never had especially high aspirations for her post-high school career , but he parents were willing to front the bill , so what the hell ? Jane 's mind seemed to be occupied with blood type a lot these days , ever since she met that boy on check-in day , you know *that boy* . Ever since she was a little girl , Jane had been raised a good Christian . She knew the rules . Rule one : no sex before marriage . Rule two : only marry a man with the same blood type . These rules seemed simple enough growing up , but now she did n't know what to think . When she saw him sitting in his Toyota Tacoma outside her dorm , with his head swaying to the beat of *Killing in the Name* by Rage Against the MAchine that bumped inside the cab , Jane knew the world as she knew it had ended . She gathered hereself as best she could and made her way to her first class . Jane endured her English 101 class without incident . She did not pay much attention , but something her teacher said about Oedipus really spoke to her . On the way out the door , she ran into *him* again . `` Hey . '' He said , letting his gaze fall over her for a brief moment . To Jane it seemed like an eternity . `` Oh , hi . '' Jane managed to muster , but he was already gone . It did n't matter . The connection must have been obvious to anyone around . Jane continued home with an extra spring in her step . She even allowed herself a moment to stop and admire the *bubblesnot* tag on the way home . She came to the conclusion that none of it mattered , not the blood type , not her idiot parent 's forcefed ideologies . She had figured it out . *He* was the one . When she ran the picture that she had taken on her phone when he was in his truck through the universal database , she found out that he was O+ , and she did n't even care . He was worth it . Jane kept her eyes peeled all of the next day for the boy of her dreams . In addtition to his blood type , she had learned that his name was James . It seemed fitting . Finally , she saw him leaving the Sciences building . He did n't notice her sitting in the panel van she had rented after class the day before , but he would . She followed him as he turned onto Main Street , and then again as he turned into a neighborhood right past the Walmart . When he finally turned into a driveway at the end of the street , she pulled the van to a halt across the street . He did n't know her blood type yet , but he would .	0.9999958276748657
Four friends , two boys and two girls , sit around a small scratched up wooden table in a half-finished basement apartment . Its floor a peeling green on concrete with fake wood trim covering the walls . They sit on high stools and stare at each other while a large cup sits on the table . Behind them , classical music plays through an ipad . An alarm on the ipad goes off , showing the alarm notification for 4am . Tommy reaches over to silence it , but leaves the Blue Danube Waltz to play on . Jenny looks around the room at everyone as she reaches for the cup . Its lukewarm kool-aid sloshing as she lifts it to her mouth . She tastes it a little and hesitates . One big gulp later , she gives a big smile now- stained red with the drink , looks at everyone in the room , and carefully puts it down . A moment later her eyes close and she falls off her chair . Sarah reaches over , feels for a pulse , and makes a knife-across-the-throat motion to Tommy and Lenny . Sarah pets Jenny 's cheek for a moment and uses the tips of her index finger to close Jenny 's blank and staring-into-space eyes . Tommy snaps up quickly knocking his chair over , opens his mouth about to say something , but quickly snaps his mouth shut , his teeth making a snapping noise , and screams right before taking a big gulp . He stands , bewildered for a moment , and falls over . Sarah is biting her fist and refuses to look at his body . Lenny just stares off into space but his eyes dart to Tommy 's still body for a moment . Tommy is sprawled into an exaggerated motion , his arms and legs sticking out in an almost comedic fashion . He twitches a little and then stops . Sarah does n't bother to check his body . She nods at Lenny and her eyes begin to tear up . Lenny puts his finger to her lips and makes a knowing look . He kisses her forehead . Lenny reaches for the cup , but Sarah stops him . They half-heartedly wrestle for the cup but Lenny gives up to Sarah as she silently mouths `` please . '' He looks down at the grain and scratches on the surface of the table for a moment . Sarah stares at the cup in her hands for a good 30 seconds . Lenny watches as she drinks it , knocking her head back in a big gulp , like how children swallow pills . His fingers tap on the wooden table louder and louder . Sarah makes one drowsy motion with her hand , trying to communicate something , but she falls over before finishing . Lenny stops tapping his fingers and stares at her body for a minute . Lenny sits for a moment staring at the cup , then the wood grain , then running his fingers over the grain then briefly touching the cup . He looks at his three dead friends , stands , and knocks the cup on the floor , spilling the poison kool-aid onto the lime green concrete floor . He looks at the red spill in a sea of green , pauses , and spits on it . He then carefully arranges the bodies in a neat row while fixing their clothes and hair as much as possible as tears run down his face . He holds each persons hand just for a few seconds each . He feels the back of their hands with his thumb , rubbing hard over the cooling skin , over and over . Finally he makes them all hold hands and face each other . He then picks up the prepared letter with all their signatures- including his own , examines the signatures for a moment , crumples it , and puts it in his front pocket . He gets into his car and drives to the police station as the radio blares some pop song , walks up to the the first person he sees , and hands the police officer the crumpled note . She looks at him quizzically for a moment , unfolds the note , reads it , and yells `` We need an ambulance at 442 Maple now '' as Lenny sits down in a chair and holds his head in his hands .	0.9999957084655762
It had n't been a good Wednesday . I was late to work because of a stoppage on the 6 train out of Murray Hill , my computer crashed right in the middle of my weekly marketing projections , and some asshole ate my deconstructed quinoa salad . Also I was hit by a Winnebago on my way to visit a Keffir cleansing clinic somewhere in Greenwich . How the Hell a Winnebago got into Manhattan , I have no idea , but I thought it would n't matter because I was dead . West Side Highway ; that had to be how they got here . Anyway , being dead , you can imagine how shocked I was to wake up inside said Winnebago . Also , as I looked out the window , I saw fields of corn and ... I do n't know ... Soybeans , maybe ? Well , it certainly was n't Midtown . `` Good morning ! '' a high , squeaky voice called from behind me , scaring the shit out of me . `` I see that you 're finally back from Central Afterlife Processing ; do you have your 12-324-A with affixed disposition statement ? '' I stared blankly at a pale , scrawny woman wearing clothing that had to be a hundred years out of fashion . She had a white bonnet and was covered in blood , her throat obviously torn apart . `` Wolves , '' she simply replied , `` but I have to take people 's word on it ; you 'll soon discover that you ca n't see your reflection anywhere . Your form ? '' `` Am I ... Am I dead ? ! '' I shouted . `` Quite . And from the look of it -- '' she pointed at my face -- `` you definitely saw it coming . '' I felt my face all over , to no avail . It was like feeling air . That 's when I suddenly noticed that I could n't feel the ground beneath me , or the clothes against my skin . There was nothing to smell , and it struck me that I was n't breathing , either . `` Holy shit , I 'm actually ... dead ... . '' `` Yes . As for the form , '' she continued politely , `` you 'll find it in your shirt pocket . '' I reached in and produced a small , yellowing scroll , sealed in blood-red wax . I slowly handed it to her , still reeling from the realization that I really , truly had died . And that I was on a Winnebago . A thought occurred to me : I turned to the driver 's area . But instead of the elderly couple who were the last living faces I ever saw , there were two women , probably in their early thirties . `` This is the RV that hit me , right ? '' `` Oh yes . According to your disposition statement , the last words you ever uttered as a living creature were -- and I quote -- 'damn it all to Hell ' . '' So the processor decided to damn this vehicle by having you haunt it . '' `` Forever ? ! '' I cried , not relishing an eternity in a Winnebago . Oh heavens no , '' she chuckled . `` Only until it is destroyed . After that , you get to disappear into eternal rest . '' `` Oh ... Well , that does n't sound so bad . How do I haunt this ? '' She simply shrugged her shoulders . `` Not my department . I just process the 12-324 forms . I 'm sure you 'll figure something out . My advice is just to focus on one thing , do n't try to do too much . '' She stood up from the bed and gave me a thumbs-up . `` Best of luck to you , sir . '' `` Hold on , '' I said . `` How long have you been doing ... All this ? '' She grimaced , her face screwed up in concentration . `` One hundred ninety-eight years . Only two to go . '' `` Why so long ? '' `` The money 's good , '' she stated simply . And in an instant , she was gone . ~~~ The funny thing is , Melissa and Juliet were really cool people . Sure , the first day was awful . I 'd tried everything I could think of : screaming as loud and as long as possible ( you can shout until the sound of your own voice annoys you , saying as you do n't need to breathe ) , banging on walls ( you 'll actually push yourself through solid material before you make a sound ) , and making things go haywire ( I can affect small electronics and electrical systems , but the worst I did was give the radio a bit of static ) . By the end if the third week , I was exhausted , mentally if not physically . While I did n't need sleep , I still took naps to alleviate the boredom . I slept on the floor of the Winnebago since I could n't feel discomfort anymore . I had been sleeping on the bed out of habit , but the second night I 'd woken up to them having sex . Even though I was dead , I thought they should have a bit of privacy . I learned a lot about them , being forced to listen to their conversations . They 'd bought the Winnebago from the old couple who 'd killed me , and were driving to Portland . Melissa had a ten-year-old daughter at a private school there who Juliet was in the process of adopting . They were both allergic to cats and loved country music . ( I never said it was a fun trip . ) I ended up not trying to haunt the Winnebago anymore ; not only was it futile , but I had a lot of reading to catch up on . Did you know that when authors die , they 're given the option to keep writing ? In fact , I was on the twenty-fifth book in the *Lord of the Rings* series ( the one where Gimli 's grandsons journey back to Middle Earth to rescue a kidnapped Legolas ) when I finally figured out how to haunt the damned Winnebago . By accident , no less . Melissa 's ( and Juliet 's at this point ) daughter Madysynn was along for a drive up to Seattle . Juliet was standing near me , making sandwiches in the kitchenette . Madysynn turned around in the passenger seat and shouted `` smile ! '' I was caught by surprise as she snapped a photo with an old-fashioned Polaroid instant camera . Thinking nothing of it , I continued reading as two of the grandsons sang a lamentation over the body of the third . `` Hey , look at that , '' Madysynn said . `` Does that look like a guy 's face ? '' I froze instantly . No way ... . I got up and crept to where she and Juliet were sitting , watching as the photo developed . Juliet appeared slowly , holding a sandwich and grinning . And sure enough , right where I was sitting , there was a vague , blurry form of a person . There was no detail to it at all , just an outline and two dark circles for eyes . If I had n't personally been sitting there , even I would n't have guessed it was me . `` Ehh , '' Juliet said , `` it 's probably just a bad spot on the film . It 's got ta be 20 years old by now . '' Madysynn looked disappointed . `` How do you know it 's not a ghost ? '' she asked . Melissa laughed . `` How on earth would an RV be haunted ? '' `` I do n't know , '' Madysynn replied , `` maybe it hit someone and they died . '' Melissa and Juliet both went ghostly pale . `` Holy crap ! '' Madysynn exclaimed , seeing the looks on their faces . `` Did someone really die ? ! '' `` Maddy , honey , '' Juliet finally said , `` there 's no such thing as ghosts . ''	0.9999955892562866
I was really motivated by this prompt . Got an account and everything to post this one , its nice to join the community so bear with me . Challenge A king and a thief have one last conversation while under siege . King Cornell stood anxiously by the fire of his tall nebulous castle . His room was the definition of regal . It was his father 's . Cornell looked at his posthumous portrait of the leader brought his kingdom peace . He always held his tongue and always made eye contact , even for a fleeting moment . Cyrus was approaching . After the coup attempt Cyrus needed to assert his dominance . Being a former noble himself he sought to take the throne of his generous childhood friend . He thought it was necessary . Cornell now had to ensure that he had the sword of center . The center sword clings loudly against the rocks . The thief sprints across enemy lines and down through the impressive moat between the castle . It was cold . Cyrus was in angst over the loss of the sword , the keepsake of his country . As a child he would watch it gleam in the old kings cabinet . Now he needed it to calm his country . It would show his prominence . Maybe he could claim more . Cornell knew that Cyrus was coming . Someone was closer . Cornell looked at his contracted thief in full knowledge of time of arrival . This was one of the best thieves in the known world . This thief was promised death many times . Cornell was tense . He could be killed instantly by the contracted hooded figure . The sword was placed in his hands under the cover of purple crushed velvet . The seven families names gleamed under the hearth and reflected into his eyes . The dry blood of his father shook him to his core . The thief did not make eye contact . He gave the king a couple minutes to fully acknowledge what he had received . He had to kill Cyrus with the blade . Cornell looked out of the window wistfully . The thief took the initiative to remove all assumption of all hostility by the fire . Darkness yielded for the king , the moonlight cast a spell on the landscape . Cornell did not trust this agent , but he did not believe the crossing of their paths came so casually . The guild sent their best , the only one that knew the king well . The thief undressed by the fire , seeking relief from the long journey and frigidity of the moment . With a face to the fire , a green eye peeled over a shoulder took a look at the sullen desperate king . Legs folded by the fire , upright . The daughter of the fallen noble , she carefully removed her soaked clothes by the fire . Cornell bewildered only saw the damaged skin on her back and one green eye held well in contact with him . Many years have passed since they last met . About a dozen actually . Cornell sat by the flames and shed a tear . Her father made this sword . Cornell felt stabbed with no wounds . She kept rigid , facing the fire looking left at her childhood peer . Christie had to outgrow the shame , and had to work hard . The look on her face was as if it was carved in . Her father was noble , she put up with Cyrus and Cornells games . Even though she was only the daughter of a Duke , she was made to be their playmate and servant . After her father died in a freak accident she was ordered to be executed . Cornell : And destiny has brought you back here . Christie : ... . ( Stares ) . Cornell : I ’ ve cursed you one more time . And forever at that . Christie : It 's one heavy ass sword . Cornell : The sins are etched in every letter . Christie : ….Quite the room you have . Cornell : I like the atrium better . We used to play hide and seek when you did n't have chores . Christie : That atrium ? It was frighteningly enormous . Took an hour to clean . Cornell : And charles would never find me , he always would ask you know who to find me . Christie : He would rub his glasses every once in awhile and just not put them on . Cornell : Ha . He always says that he lost a pair . Christie : I remember when cyrus decided to hide in the potting jar . Or was it a fountain ? Cornell : They ’ re all fountains now . It was a jar because… Christie : I had to clean his stupid ass cause he had dirt all over him . Cornell : Did he ever apologize ? Christie : He said sorry , then invited me to dinner . Cornell : Did he start a war after that ? Christie : Nope , but i think i should have . Cornell : War at 12 ? Christie : 11 dishes for the archduke ’ s son . By his maid ! The madness . Cornell : You mean my maid . Christie : I ’ ve made up your bed and his and i 've always slept in my own . Cornell : Liar , you never needed sleep . I could never get any wine out of the cellar . Christie : Sleep was for mortals . And you could never find the key to that cellar now could you . Cornell : Whenever that cellar was open we could say whatever we wanted . Christie : That crap is poison . Cornell : Poison makes for good cooking . Christie : How much you have left ? Cornell : It ’ s all for the man walking up the steps to come and kill us . Its all thats left of my kingdom . How much poison do you have left ? Christie : Just Enough . [ Erotica or death ensues . ]	0.9999958276748657
06/05/04 Lilith , I am sorry for the hand that life has dealt you . I did not get so lucky either , but at least you have made it this far . This is the only thing I have left behind , and I am sorry that I have to say this . I dated this the day I died , and had a friend leave it for you where you found it . I was the one who sent the anonymous messages online when you were struggling , praying that they would give you hope . Like I 've said before , you were , and are , friendly , wonderful , and your courage gave me hope to fight against my crummy illness . I even remember how you joked about being a `` soulmate '' with an anonymous messenger , and I know how you wished I would reveal myself . I hope you forgive me , I was not ready . I remembered seeing your post about how sad you were when they took out the tree in front of your apartment complex , so I asked to be buried beneath a sapling nearby . It will probably be marked with a small stone . I am hoping that by now , it has grown strong , like you . I hope it gives you shade for when you read , and that it 's bark is soft and comfortable to rest on . I may have never been able to meet you in person , but I pray that even in death , I can still , in some way , offer you the support and comfort that I had dreamed of giving when I was alive . I hope that life has treated you better , and even if you still have hard times , remember that you are strong and kind , and you are loved . Best wishes , Erik , the soulmate	4.437627922015963e-06
