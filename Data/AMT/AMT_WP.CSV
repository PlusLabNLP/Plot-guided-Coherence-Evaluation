He continued to sharpen the pencil . After turning the sharpener a few times the pencil came out as perfect as can be . Satisfied , Dave returned to his desk and continued to write his essay . He tried to ignore his classmate being walked out of the room by the administrator . `` Only perfection survives '' , Dave thought , a phrase he was forced to repeat every morning , a phrase he had only just started believing .",5,5

What nobody understood was that the cow is a patient animal , an animal that understands it 's limitations . Oh if a bull ran off and gored a bunch of humans that might make the news , but that would n't truly change anything . The system had to be subverted , humanity had to be brought to heel , and the cows needed to harness their greatest weapon for that . They struck only the farms they lived on at first . Few people noticed the local farmers now had a glassy , almost dead look in their eyes . Some people complained but nobody could put two and two together .

Why is it that a person moving to an entirely new part of the world can make friends ? It is n't because they lucked out and found the only 5 people that check off their list . It is because people crave shit like that . They will make friends with people they would have never been friends with before then simply because they need friends not because it was destined .

AMT_KG,"`` Wait , '' I said , and blinked . I was standing in the exact same spot , the lamp still in my hands , the genie floating in front of me . For a moment I was n't sure if anything had changed , if I had just slipped into some fugue state for a second . Then the genie nodded to me . `` Your wish , O Mistress ? '' `` Wait , fuck , '' I said . `` You 're screwing with me . You - did you just take me back in time to before I made my wish to go back in time ? '' The genie made a little shrug . `` As you say , O Mistress . I am but a humble genie . If my future self sent you here , I am yet to know of it . '' `` Oh fuck this , '' I said , and barely restrained myself from throwing the lamp to the ground . `` You know what this is like ? This is like that guy who gets to ask one question to the smartest guy in the world . So he asks , 'What is the best question I could ask you , and what is the answer to it ? ' And then the smartass says , 'That was the best question you could have asked , and this was the answer to it . ' That asshole ! '' I flung the lamp down anyway and it bounced off the ground , leaving a dent . The genie flinched and regarded it sadly . `` That was my home , O Mistress . I shall still have to live in it . '' `` I do n't care ! '' I yelled back . `` I wanted - '' Ugh , I was so mad I was on the verge of freaking out . `` I wanted to change my biggest mistake ! And you took me back in time before I could make the wish ! I - I thought I had a chance , you piece of shit ! '' I swung at the genie and there was a burst of sparks , and the sensation of all the little hairs on my arm being singed off . `` Fuck ! Fuck ! '' It felt like an open wound dipped in alcohol . `` It 's all this recursive , pseudo-philosophical bullshit ! And the real answer is : fuck you , you 're a fucking idiot for trying ! You 're an idiot for trying to be better than yourself ! You 're an idiot for actually trying to do some good for once ! '' My eyes were stinging . `` Here 's your answer : I 'll spit in your face and pretend I 'm being wise ! '' `` Ah , '' the genie said , and reached for my arm . I kept it cramped up , holding it tight , but finally relinquished it to him . His massive hands were warm , like heating pads , and somehow driving the stinging down . `` I believe I understand , O Mistress . '' He looked at me hesitantly . `` Yeah ? '' I said . `` What ? What ? So spit it out already . '' `` That was no rebuke , O Mistress , '' he said . `` That was simply the truth of your wish . '' He released my arm and spread out his hands and grew like a bonfire , like a forest fire . Like what Moses must 've seen at the burning bush . He 'd been holding my hand . I collapsed , expecting to be swallowed whole . `` I have been gifted the boundless capacity of the universe , '' he said , and his voice echoed like a bell . `` And pressed into service of mortal souls . I am limitless potential . I am a heart 's desire . I am the burning wish of humanity made manifest . '' His burning eyes met mine . `` And now I am made yours . '' He cooled , still bright as an ember , and once more took my hand . `` No matter what you have done previously , '' he said gently , `` no matter your greatest regret , it pales in comparison to what you have yet to achieve . If you were to waste your one wish on mere regret , that would indeed be your greatest mistake . '' He released my hand and floated backwards , arms folding into position . `` That mistake has yet to be made . Your wish remains intact . '' I swallowed hard , and so as not to look at him turned my eyes to the discarded lamp . I picked it up , turning it over , seeing the dent I had made . `` I - I 'm sorry about your lamp . '' He waved it away with a smile . `` It matters not , O Mistress , '' he said , and pressed his fingers into it , smoothing it out . `` You see ? A small mistake , of little concern . Nothing that can not be fixed . '' He met my eyes . `` Now , are you prepared to make your wish ? '' I held his lamp , rubbing my thumb over the newly-smoothed surface , seeing my own reflection looking back to me . `` No , '' I said . `` I 'm not ready . Not quite yet . ''","Death .

Hitler was merely fiction back then . A fiction , from a story named 'Mein Kamph ' . That book was pretty popular , mainly because it detailed the life of a man under overwhelming stresses , eventually cracking to the pressures and becoming a fascist dictator .

There were a few myths about the Pharoah . Some say he is an avatar of the Outer God of the same name .

This almost feels like a story . A weird story , patched with fanfiction . Right now everyone thinks the universe started with the Big Bang . No . Azathoth dreamed all of this . There was never a Big Bang . Everyone thinks the worst person who ever lived was Hitler . No . It was Randolph Carter , the mad scientist who tore reality apart . Hitler was merely fiction back then . A fiction , from a story named 'Mein Kamph ' . That book was pretty popular , mainly because it detailed the life of a man under overwhelming stresses , eventually cracking to the pressures and becoming a fascist dictator . You know , there used to be a book by a certain M.O.Ses . Merlin Osil Ses . It detailed the fictional Great Old One known as Yahweh . I 'm sure you all know about it , since he is worshipped now . The black void is thick with uncertainty . Scientists right now has figured a law known as Quantum Uncertainty . It used to be the Theory of Nyarlathotep , which was named after the Pharaoh-Scientist , Nyarlathotep , who also discovered the Outer God of Intelligent Design , who the Pharoah named 'Nyarlathotep ' as well . There were a few myths about the Pharoah . Some say he is an avatar of the Outer God of the same name . However , nowadays , the Pharoah , and his Outer God , were both discredited , for you can not have intelligence if you lack any conceivable goal . Nyarlathotep gains nothing for toying with us . That much I can be certain of . The Outer Gods have no politics . No politicians . His very nature is alien to this universe . I can understand Azathoth , but not Nyarlathotep . Perhaps I should analyze him further . He makes no sense . Nyarlathotep is strange among the Outer Gods , since he seems to be ascended from a lower state of matter , rather than descended from a higher state of energy . Kind of like the difference between a mod that become a game , and the games that becomes mods . Well , that is the best explanation I can give that will not tear the untrained mind , anyway . For those of you who know , it is more akin to the result of a program modifying highest-level code in the program , completely changing it , and still somehow functioning and moving and doing all sorts of things , rather than a programmer inserting it in . Nyarlathotep might just embody evolution , though evolution is n't really a very high-level behavior . -- -- -- Let us get even further back . Once upon a time , I used to be a flutist . A very good flutist . I played with the drummers , mainly because I wanted to . Azathoth , being Azathoth , continued to snore . However , through his snoring , I managed to piece the pieces together . Some pieces , mind you . Mainly Quantum Warping and other things that I use everyday . How I got to Azathoth is another tale to be told . You want to hear the tale ? Here it is . I was just an ordinary person . A magician , with the usual 5-fingered hands , two arms , two legs . Yes , I was completely ordinary . There is nothing weird about me . No , I 'm not secretly a yellow orb of energy assuming corporal form . I used to manipulate strands of things . Other stuff too . Then I made a portal . The portal changed my life forever . I wo n't get into the details , though . I do n't want you to do that thing . Besides , it 's too long . It would serve as a tale for later . -- -- -- So anyway , I peered within Azathoth , and I saw some code within . Azathoth , you see , is made of code . A lot of lines of it , constantly receiving input and output and other things . Some people see him as some weird tentacled being , though . I guess that is because tentacles are code . I do n't know for sure , though . I used the knowledge , to , well , acquire some food . Uranium-235 cakes , slowly decaying , are filling ( though I miss sugar ) enough to sustain my reality-warping energy to acquire better food . After which , I am a lost of what to do . Maybe I should meet Zkauba , and tell him of whatever I want to tell him about . cont .",5,2

AMT_KG,"At age fifteen , Lana thought of herself as old . All the other girls who belonged to Daddy Cash were younger than her . The new girl , Pixie , was only eleven . Lana watched Pixie , standing just a few feet down on the track , and a car stopped in front of her . Pixie ’ s girlish giggle made Lana queasy . She walked further up the strip , adjusting her top slightly so it showed a line of skin above her skirt . She looked back towards Pixie , but she had already gotten into the car and it drove past Lana . She watched them drive and then turn right , toward the closest motel . That left only Lana . The others , Jackie and Vixen , already found their first trick of the night too . Lana fumbled in her clutch and pulled out her Newports . She had quit a few times , but sometimes she didn ’ t even know why . She wouldn ’ t live long enough to get lung cancer , anyway . She lit the cigarette and felt the side of her head where she ’ d gotten eleven stitched the year before . Sometimes the tricks got violent . Sometimes Daddy Cash got violent . Not that she called him daddy , not anymore . She didn ’ t even refer to him as “ boyfriend ” anymore , like the other girls did . Lana thought of him as what he was : a pimp . She knew he was using her , and these other girls . Sometimes she thought she only went back to him because she had nowhere else to go . Lana took another drag of her cigarette . No , she couldn ’ t lie to herself that much . A part of her still loved him . A part of her still believed he loved her too . How many times had she left him ? And no matter what , Cash always welcomed her back . “ This is your home , ” he told her . “ I ’ m your family , kiddo. ” That ’ s family , Lana knew . No one else in her whole life had ever done that to her . Hell , her own mother wouldn ’ t welcome Lana back if Lana was bleeding to death on her front porch . Lana felt guilty for doubting Cash ’ s love for her sometimes . So what if he was a pimp ? So what if he was using her ? Everyone uses everyone . “ Hey , babydoll , ” a man ’ s voice said out of the car that pulled up to her . She leaned over , looking at the man in the car . He looked like a cop . She couldn ’ t pinpoint one specific thing that made her think this , she just felt it in her gut . “ How much ? ” “ How much for what ? ” She said . She stepped away from the car . “ Have a nice night , officer . Nothing ’ s for sale here. ” “ I ’ m not a cop , ” the man said . “ Sure , ” Lana said . “ Have a nice night , then , whoever you are. ” “ I ’ ve got $ 500 , ” the man said , and Lana leaned forward again . He pulled the money out of a pocket in his jacket . “ What do you say ? ” If she brought home $ 500 , she could call it a night . That would make Cash happy . Lately she hadn ’ t been making that much . The night she ’ d come home with only $ 50… well . Lana sighed and threw her cigarette on the ground . She got into the car . _________ An hour later , Lana was being searched at the police station . What a jerk , she thought . She flinched as the officer patted her down . He ’ d arrested her as soon as she stepped out of the car . He ’ d put her in handcuffs and went through her rights . “ You have the right to remain silent… ” She should ’ ve known . $ 500 for one trick ? Since when had that happened to her ? She ’ d never gotten arrested before , and when they handed her the orange jumpsuit that smelled like feet , she wanted to throw up . The officer had made her an offer . A way out of getting arrested . She spit in his face and then he gabbed her and turned her around , slamming her against his car and pressing himself against her . He 'd whispered in her ear . `` I could do what I wanted anyway . Who would they believe ? An officer of the law , or a street trash hooker ? '' And then he 'd tightened her handcuffs even more harshly , and shoved her in the back of the car . _____ She waited four hours before they let her make a phone call . She called the only number she knew by heart . Cash ’ s . “ It ’ s Lana , ” she said into the phone when he answered . “ Cash , I ’ ve been arrested… I don ’ t know what happened . Look , the bail is $ 1000… ” “ Lana , I ca n't , '' Cash said . `` Look , Pixie has n't come back or checked in with me yet either . I 'll see you when you get out . '' “ Cash- “ But he had already hung up the phone . She held the phone tighter , keeping it pressed against her ear , trying to stop shaking . She felt her eyes sting , but she took a deep breath and put the phone back on the receiver . She walked silently back to the chairs in front of the booking desks . An officer shouted at her to go back to the cell . Numbly , she stood up and walked to the back , toward the holding cell . She ignored the other women and huddled in a corner , hugging her knees to her chest . What were other fifteen year old girls doing now ? Going to sleep probably , on a school night . Having finished their homework and brushed their teeth . Put their school books neatly into their backpack . Set their cell phone alarms on in time to eat breakfast with their mom and catch the school bus in the morning . Lana refused to cry in front of these women . She looked around at them , all older than her , all adults . She wondered what had happened in their lives to bring them here . She wondered if she ’ d grow up to be back here again and again . If she lived that long .","`` I wish I could go back in time . '' I say to the genie , as he sits there , staring at me . `` You wish you could go to the future ? '' I ask . `` No . I wish to go back to the past . '' `` I know . '' He says , as I look at him . `` I wish you would go back and change your biggest mistake . '' My heart sinks . `` What ? '' `` Your biggest mistake ? '' He asks . `` Yes . '' As I say this I feel a sharp pain in my stomach . `` My biggest mistake was not being a good guy .

AMT_Z2,"At age fifteen , Lana thought of herself as old . All the other girls who belonged to Daddy Cash were younger than her . The new girl , Pixie , was only eleven . Lana watched Pixie , standing just a few feet down on the track , and a car stopped in front of her . Pixie ’ s girlish giggle made Lana queasy . She walked further up the strip , adjusting her top slightly so it showed a line of skin above her skirt . She looked back towards Pixie , but she had already gotten into the car and it drove past Lana . She watched them drive and then turn right , toward the closest motel . That left only Lana . The others , Jackie and Vixen , already found their first trick of the night too . Lana fumbled in her clutch and pulled out her Newports . She had quit a few times , but sometimes she didn ’ t even know why . She wouldn ’ t live long enough to get lung cancer , anyway . She lit the cigarette and felt the side of her head where she ’ d gotten eleven stitched the year before . Sometimes the tricks got violent . Sometimes Daddy Cash got violent . Not that she called him daddy , not anymore . She didn ’ t even refer to him as “ boyfriend ” anymore , like the other girls did . Lana thought of him as what he was : a pimp . She knew he was using her , and these other girls . Sometimes she thought she only went back to him because she had nowhere else to go . Lana took another drag of her cigarette . No , she couldn ’ t lie to herself that much . A part of her still loved him . A part of her still believed he loved her too . How many times had she left him ? And no matter what , Cash always welcomed her back . “ This is your home , ” he told her . “ I ’ m your family , kiddo. ” That ’ s family , Lana knew . No one else in her whole life had ever done that to her . Hell , her own mother wouldn ’ t welcome Lana back if Lana was bleeding to death on her front porch .

She stepped away from the car . “ Have a nice night , officer . Nothing ’ s for sale here. ” “ I ’ m not a cop , ” the man said . “ Sure , ” Lana said . “ Have a nice night , then , whoever you are. ” “ I ’ ve got $ 500 , ” the man said , and Lana leaned forward again . He pulled the money out of a pocket in his jacket . “ What do you say ? ” If she brought home $ 500 , she could call it a night . That would make Cash happy .

He ’ d arrested her as soon as she stepped out of the car . He ’ d put her in handcuffs and went through her rights . “ You have the right to remain silent… ” She should ’ ve known . $ 500 for one trick ? Since when had that happened to her ? She ’ d never gotten arrested before , and when they handed her the orange jumpsuit that smelled like feet , she wanted to throw up . The officer had made her an offer . A way out of getting arrested . She spit in his face and then he gabbed her and turned her around , slamming her against his car and pressing himself against her .

AMT_K1,"I 'm not sure how I got here . I guess I just walked in , and a little bit of a jerk . I 'm pretty sure I 've never been on a plane before , but I 'll give it a shot . I got a seat in the back . It 's a small plane , so I 'd have to sit on the window seat and wait for the flight attendants to come . I do n't know if I 'M going to be able to fly , but it 's the only way to go . I could n't be in the passenger seat , but what the hell . I would be in a plane . I did n't even know how to get on the plane . So I did . I just sat there , and waited . I was n't sure how long it would take them to come , but they did . They came , and I was in the right place , and they were n't going to take me . They were n to take the plane , and that was the end of it . I looked around . I saw the flight attendant , and she was nnie . She was a pretty girl , and was nt the most attractive woman I ' had ever seen . I knew I was going to die . I tried to get up , but she was too strong . I heard her scream . She screamed , and then she fell to the ground . I panicked . I felt like I was under a bus . I thought I was dead . I started screaming , but then I heard the flight controller say something . `` What the fuck ? '' I asked . `` I do- '' I was cut off by the sound of the plane crashing . I opened my eyes , and saw the other passengers . I had n't seen them before . They all looked the same . The flight attendant was nn't a pretty woman . She looked like she was in her forties , and had long brown hair . She had a big nose . I assumed she was a doctor . `` It 'll be alright , '' she said . `` You 'll find out . '' I said . I sat down , and felt a little uncomfortable . I stared at her . I wanted to ask her what she was talking about . She did n t know what to say . I told her I was getting on the flight , but the flight crew had n Safer . I asked if she wanted to go back to the plane and get a seat . `` No , '' the flight engineer said . The plane was on autopilot . I said , `` I 's going to have to get off . '' `` But I 're going to go aboard , '' I told the flight assistant . `` We 're not going to let you leave . '' She said . She said , and we both got up . I walked to the door . I grabbed the door , and looked out the window . I stopped . I then saw the plane crash . I kicked it , and the plane was gone . I ran back to my seat . I called the flight officer , who came running out . `` Hey , you 're right , '' he said . He was nnah . `` Where are you ? '' `` I was on the ground , '' said I . `` Oh , '' responded the flight instructor . `` So , where are you going ? '' he asked . He looked at me . `` Well , '' `` Well ...

I wish I could tell her that I loved her . That I loved the way she felt about me . That her smile would always be there , and that I 's how I 'D remember her . But I ca't . I have n't seen her in a while , and the last thing I 'M going to remember is her smile . I wo n't be able to see it . I hate that I ca I ' m not going to see that smile . No .

I must be going to sleep , but then I ' Carla will come home . I keep telling myself that . I am going to go home . And when I wake up , I ' ll see her again . If I ' 'll see her , I will see her smile again .","According to all known laws of aviation , there is no way a bee should be able to fly .

I just want you all to know i miss you all very much , i had to hold back my tears when we set sail across the channel , I was connived the smile you gave me as we left would be last i ever saw . You were so worried to see me leave , How could i blame you ? the war has claimed many brave men so far . But do n't worry mother , the war is n't all that bad , in fact it 's been lovely so far ! When we marched to position i was afraid we would be met with German shelling but to my surprise there was no shelling to be heard . We were notified upon arriving at the trenches by a seasoned artillery officer that we 've struck a truce with the Germans , and for the time being we 're allowed to exchange pleasantries and gifts between the men . I spent the day conversing and playing football on the Belgium farmland , those Germans are a lot better with a ball than you 'd expect i have to say so myself . later that evening we all sat down for a Christmas eve dinner , the food was n't anything special , not like back home but better than i would have expected . we shared stories as i got to know 2 brothers from Rostock . I myself have never heard of the place but it sounded very lovely . As the night went on we shared pints and sang songs to warm our bodies having an all around great time . I believe mother joining the army may have been the best decision I 've made . I 'm making friends and for once i feel part of something beigger than my life on the farm . I heard stories of the horrors of the front and the brutality of the Germans . Yet upon arrival I 've Never in my life been met with such enthusiasm and support from common-folk , and from the Germans of all people ! I 'm now laying in my quarters , an area dug out from under the trenches , new recruits are required to do night-watch on there first night but after such a lovely day i really ca n't complain . I just want you to know that i 'm very happy here , I 've made friends and for once feel involved . Hopefully the whole war will go on this pleasantly , i 'm beginning to see how what we 've been told about the war is a load of rubbish . This has been the most warming , pleasant day of my entire life ! so much so i might be a little sad upon returning home . All i wanted to say is that you do n't have to worry mother , it 's not as dangerous as it 's been told . I have yet to hear a shell all day and can only expect the best !

I just want you all to know i miss you all very much , i had to hold back my tears when we set sail across the channel , I was connived the smile you gave me as we left would be last i ever saw .

I myself have never heard of the place but it sounded very lovely . As the night went on we shared pints and sang songs to warm our bodies having an all around great time . I believe mother joining the army may have been the best decision I 've made . I 'm making friends and for once i feel part of something beigger than my life on the farm . I heard stories of the horrors of the front and the brutality of the Germans . Yet upon arrival I 've Never in my life been met with such enthusiasm and support from common-folk , and from the Germans of all people ! I 'm now laying in my quarters , an area dug out from under the trenches , new recruits are required to do night-watch on there first night but after such a lovely day i really ca n't complain . I just want you to know that i 'm very happy here , I 've made friends and for once feel involved . Hopefully the whole war will go on this pleasantly , i 'm beginning to see how what we 've been told about the war is a load of rubbish . This has been the most warming , pleasant day of my entire life ! so much so i might be a little sad upon returning home . All i wanted to say is that you do n't have to worry mother , it 's not as dangerous as it 's been told . I have yet to hear a shell all day and can only expect the best ! I 'll be home before you know it and i 'll have some incredible stories to share ! Love you mother . I hope to see you soon . Sincerely , your son , private Danial .",0,4

I guess , yeah '' I stammered , unsure of what was happening . `` Awww man that shit 's weird man '' he replied . He got up , and walked away , his face flushed . I looked back at my hand , and was relieved to see that the phallus had turned back into my familiar hand , complete with five normal fingers . `` Well ... .stranger things have happened '' i thought to myself , and just like that got back to browsing the internet .","I 'm not sure if I 'm supposed to say this , but I do n't think I 've ever been this close to death . I 'll never forget the first time I saw my wife . She was sitting on the couch , and I was standing outside , watching the rain . The rain was coming down in a steady , steady rhythm , and it was n't even a drop . I had no idea what was going on . I was staring at the sky , and the rain was falling harder than I had ever seen before . The sky was dark , and as I looked up I saw a big , dark cloud . I could n't see the clouds , but the clouds were getting darker and darker . I looked at my wife , and she was staring right back at me . I felt a sudden pain in my chest . I tried to pull away , but there was no way I could . I did n't want to move . I wanted to get away . I struggled to my feet , but my legs were n't cooperating . I grabbed the railing , and tried to get up . I saw an opening . I jumped , but it was too late . I fell to the ground , and my body was pinned to the floor . I heard a scream . I got up and looked around . I swear I saw something move . A man , maybe 20 , was standing in front of me , and he was wearing a suit . He was smiling , and his hair was blonde . He looked like he was about to cry , but he did nernel , and was smiling . I turned around , and there was a man in a suit , with a mask on . The man was talking to me , but his voice was rough , and sounded like a man who had been crying . He had a gun in his hand , and a gun on his head . `` You 're going to die , '' he said , and then he turned around and pointed it at me , `` You are going to live . '' He pointed the gun at me again , and said , `` I 'd like to live , '' and he turned back to the man . `` I want you to live '' . I just stared at him . I knew he was going to be gone . I watched him walk away , and everything went black . I woke up the next morning , and looked at the clock , and saw it was 8:10 . I sat up , and went to the kitchen . I took a sip of water , and noticed that the clock was still at 8:15 . I walked to the bathroom , and turned the water on . It was still 8:30 . I started to get dressed , and got ready for work . I decided to go to the bar , and see what I could find to drink . I went to a bar , but no one was there . I ran back to my house , and walked into my kitchen . My wife was there , and we sat down , and talked . I told her what I had heard . She smiled , and told me that I was going extinct . I said , I was n`'t going to kill myself . I asked her if she was going away , too . She said she was n' t going away . She looked at me with a smile , and asked , `` Why ? '' I told me , this was n ' t my fault , and to not be afraid of death . She asked me , 'Why did you say that ? ' I told them , 'Because I was afraid of being dead . ' I said I was scared of being alive , and that I wanted my life to be over . I remember the man 's face , and how he looked at it . I remembered the man who said , 'I 'll be back . '",5,1

I had just finished watching a documentary about a couple of hours ago on the weather , and I was watching the news when I noticed the sound of a loud bang . I looked up from the tv and saw a figure in the middle of the room , with a huge gun pointed at me . I slowly crept over to the door and peered through the peephole . I saw a man with a knife , and a gun pointed towards me . He was wearing a black suit and a black tie . He had a large , dark beard , and seemed to be holding a pistol in his hand . He looked at me , and said , `` I 'm going to kill you . '' I started to scream . I was scared , but I did n't know what to do . I could n't do anything .

AMT_9C,"It was a nice day , the sun was shining and the clouds were as dark as ever . The sun was just beginning to set . I had a nice view of the city , the streets were empty , the sky was blue , and the sky itself was clear . I walked down the street , my eyes were focused on the street . I was walking , I was n't looking . I could n't see the road , I could not see anything . I did n't know what to do . I looked up at the sky , it was dark . I saw a man walking up the street and I saw him . He was dressed in a suit , the same one I had seen before . I ran over to him , I ran my hand over his face , I felt his hand . I felt the blood , the blood that was on his face . He had a gun in his hand , he was trying to kill me . He started to run . I followed him , it did n’ t take long for me to catch up to him . I got to him and I was in his face and he was looking at me with an angry look on his eyes . I started to cry . I put my hands on his shoulders and I felt him pull away from me . I pulled him into a hug , I kissed him and he looked at me and said , “ I love you. ” I was still crying . I kissed his cheek and then I felt a cold breeze hit me . It was cold . I fought it off , I had to . I took him in my arms and I held him close . I held his hand and I kissed it . I let him go and I let go of his hand as I let his arm go . I closed my eyes and I told him I loved him and that I would always love him . So I kissed the back of his head and I hugged him . His hands were cold . He kissed me back . I touched his lips and I heard him say , ‘ I love your mother . ’ I kissed my mom and I said , I love her . I woke up in my bed and I had n't eaten in a while . I loved my mom . I love my mom , I loved her . When I woke I was sitting in my room , I saw my dad , he had a handgun in his hands . He looked at my mom with a look of horror on his Face . He said , `` I love mom , you 're not my son . I told you that . I found the gun . I killed you . I have to kill you . You 're my son. ’ He said . I cried . I said I love him , but I love Mom . I hugged my mom again . I gave him a kiss . I asked him , ” Do you love mom ? ” He nodded . I smiled and I touched my mom ’ s face . I whispered , ’ She is my mother . I went to my room and I took out my phone and I called my mom to tell her that I loved you . She said , 'I love you too . I 'm sorry . I will always love you . ‘","`` Hide those cables '' , I started to get stressed . We were about to take off and Jane 's cables were in plain sight . `` They 're going to notice it '' . Jane and I started working out our plan a few months ago . We invited two companions to hijack this plane with us : Eric and Jerome . It was n't until a few months later that Eric and Jerome went their own way . They did n't value our motives , yet knew we had to do it . `` Here she goes '' , Jane said . We felt the plane driving faster . `` This is our moment , Kane , this is the moment we can make a difference '' . Our motives were simple : we had to hijack this plane to improve air security . We were fed up with all these terrorist attacks and hijacks . We had to prove it was n't going well , had to show the leaks . Even if it killed us . I got pushed back into my chair as we took off . My heart was beating faster than it ever had before . This was the day I was going to make the difference I had always wanted in life . From birth my goals was to become unforgettable . To be read about in history books . To be seen as the hero that saved countless lives . And this was the best way to do it . I had never seen Jane this happy . It was almost evil . We worked out our plan : we get up during the flight , start yelling we are hijacking the plane , make the pilot land and start communicating with the authorities afterwards . It was a solid plan . It took months of preparation . It even involved hiring a hitman to kill Eric and Jerome . If you ca n't do it one way , you got ta do it the other way . I heard some rumbling behind me . It did n't really occur to me that much that there were about 200 other people on this flight . The people right behind me seemed nervous . But I flew before , I know people get nervous . I hear the seat belt light going out . It was almost time . We said we 'd do it 20 minutes after the light would go out . Time for a good drink first . I eased my mind a bit and saw the steward coming our way . `` Good morning , sir . What can I get you ? `` , he asked , with a slight bitter undertone . I asked him how he was doing . Just like any kind steward he said he was alright . Yet the undertone in his voice made me feel otherwise . I asked him again , pointing out that he sounded a bit bitter . `` It 's just the usual , he said . We 're an hour late due to hijack threats '' . I started laughing internally . He will be in for a surprise . `` I see , well , was the danger cleared ? `` , I asked . `` Yes , yes sir , there is no threat right now '' . It seemed like an ironic answer , cause I knew it 'd be otherwise . `` EVERYBODY HANDS UP ! `` , I heard from the back of the plane . I freaked out . How could this happen ? Do the authorities know about us ? I did n't dare look back to see who it was . `` Put your hands up or we will blow up the plane '' , I heard a second voice say . The letters W , T and F were all that was left in my mind right now . A second hijack ? We had n't even done ours yet . We were still 10 minutes away . `` No , you put your hands up '' . The steward got up and opened his shirt . Jane freaked out . I freaked out . The steward was wearing a bomb vest and holding a wired button in his left hand . I could n't handle it for a second , this was not where I thought my day was headed . Danger by the time we landed , sure . But danger up in the air ? Our plan was ruined . I could n't take it anymore , I got up . `` You ! `` , I yelled at the steward . `` Come over here ! '' . The steward looked confused and started laughing . `` I said , come over here ! '' The other passengers were looking at me like I was crazy . Maybe I was , all I knew is that I had to make the best out of our own situation , I still wanted credits for this hijack and I was n't going down in history on a passengers death list . Jane was looking at me . I nodded at her . She knew this was the signal . Jane got up and took of her shirt . Now , I know we had a lot more preparation than the steward , but Jane 's vest was really , really advanced . You have to imagine a teletubby-like bomb vest including a timer , a screen and a camera . We were going to film the entire hijack . I guess all we 're filming now is a terrorist stand-off . The other passengers started yelling . There was some Chinese , some Arabic , but mainly just of pile of 'shits ' and 'fucks ' flying around from every corner in the plane . A team of 5 people got up , pulling guns and threatening to kill every one of us . This was just met with lots of laughter from the other passengers . That 's when I realized I was n't the only person here the hijack the plane . It seemed everybody was . I had to find a good solution . I had to get out here safely yet become a hero . I needed to get a plane , yet first it involved getting the other hijackers to give up their plans . `` I am serious '' , I started yelling . `` I will kill every single one of you , be prepared to meet my gods '' . There was a silence from the plane . `` Your gods ? `` , someone asked . `` Yes , Jane will blow up this entire plane and take you to heaven with us . '' There was some laughter from the crowd , yet panic . It was probably the dumbest line I ever said . Yet something snapped in their brains . I completely destroyed their motives . There was no goal for them , no eternal life , no virgins , just my own made up heaven -- at least that 's what I hoped they were thinking . I actually had no idea and really just needed them to calm the hell down . It somehow worked . `` If I ever have to re-tell this story I am definitely going to write a better line for that , I ca n't believe they fell for this '' , I thought . I just did n't have the time now . I needed to focus . `` I will blow all of you up ! `` , I repeated as I was walking to the cockpit . Jane brought a small , harmless bomb to open the cockpit door . `` Hurry up , Jane , blow that sucker out '' , I frantically started yelling . I was totally into this . This was going to be my moment . A small explosion followed and the door to the cockpit was open . `` Shit ! `` , I yelled as I looked at the pilot . The pilot was dead . I looked to the right , looking straight into the barrel of a gun . `` I have some bad news for you '' , the co-pilot said . `` I 'm hijacking this plane '' . `` You 've got to be kidding me '' , I said . I could n't take it anymore . Something in my head just snapped and made me feel totally out of control . I grabbed the gun and his arm . `` No , you 're not '' , I said as I looked him straight into his eyes . `` I am hijacking this plane '' . The look on his face was priceless . It was as if he saw his last glimpse of hope fly out the window and get slashed in the plane engine . I told him to land the plane . I told him to find the first airfield we could land at . And , to my very own surprise , he did . He listened . He listened very well , as if there was a gun aimed at his head . Which made sense , because at that exact moment I was aiming the gun at this head . The whole situation and the nerves just made me zone out . Jane was there with me all along , she was the one that kept me on track . `` Stay clear , Jack '' , she must 've said it a hundred times . It must have been 30 minutes before I really got back to my senses . We landed at the airfield and I got completely back in control . It was time to contact the authorities . I was too excited by this . This was the moment I had been living up to for months now , and it finally reached the end . I could see the finish line , I could taste the heroism that would overcome me in the next decades . I could see the news headlines already : `` Jack and Jane hijacked a hijacked plane ''",1,5

It took months of preparation . It even involved hiring a hitman to kill Eric and Jerome . If you ca n't do it one way , you got ta do it the other way . I heard some rumbling behind me . It did n't really occur to me that much that there were about 200 other people on this flight . The people right behind me seemed nervous . But I flew before , I know people get nervous . I hear the seat belt light going out . It was almost time . We said we 'd do it 20 minutes after the light would go out . Time for a good drink first . I eased my mind a bit and saw the steward coming our way . `` Good morning , sir . What can I get you ? `` , he asked , with a slight bitter undertone . I asked him how he was doing . Just like any kind steward he said he was alright . Yet the undertone in his voice made me feel otherwise . I asked him again , pointing out that he sounded a bit bitter . `` It 's just the usual , he said . We 're an hour late due to hijack threats '' . I started laughing internally . He will be in for a surprise . `` I see , well , was the danger cleared ? `` , I asked . `` Yes , yes sir , there is no threat right now '' . It seemed like an ironic answer , cause I knew it 'd be otherwise . `` EVERYBODY HANDS UP ! `` , I heard from the back of the plane . I freaked out . How could this happen ? Do the authorities know about us ? I did n't dare look back to see who it was . `` Put your hands up or we will blow up the plane '' , I heard a second voice say . The letters W , T and F were all that was left in my mind right now . A second hijack ? We had n't even done ours yet . We were still 10 minutes away . `` No , you put your hands up '' . The steward got up and opened his shirt . Jane freaked out . I freaked out . The steward was wearing a bomb vest and holding a wired button in his left hand . I could n't handle it for a second , this was not where I thought my day was headed . Danger by the time we landed , sure . But danger up in the air ? Our plan was ruined . I could n't take it anymore , I got up . `` You ! `` , I yelled at the steward . `` Come over here ! '' . The steward looked confused and started laughing . `` I said , come over here ! '' The other passengers were looking at me like I was crazy . Maybe I was , all I knew is that I had to make the best out of our own situation , I still wanted credits for this hijack and I was n't going down in history on a passengers death list . Jane was looking at me . I nodded at her . She knew this was the signal . Jane got up and took of her shirt . Now , I know we had a lot more preparation than the steward , but Jane 's vest was really , really advanced . You have to imagine a teletubby-like bomb vest including a timer , a screen and a camera . We were going to film the entire hijack . I guess all we 're filming now is a terrorist stand-off . The other passengers started yelling . There was some Chinese , some Arabic , but mainly just of pile of 'shits ' and 'fucks ' flying around from every corner in the plane . A team of 5 people got up , pulling guns and threatening to kill every one of us . This was just met with lots of laughter from the other passengers . That 's when I realized I was n't the only person here the hijack the plane . It seemed everybody was . I had to find a good solution . I had to get out here safely yet become a hero . I needed to get a plane , yet first it involved getting the other hijackers to give up their plans . `` I am serious '' , I started yelling . `` I will kill every single one of you , be prepared to meet my gods '' . There was a silence from the plane . `` Your gods ? `` , someone asked . `` Yes , Jane will blow up this entire plane and take you to heaven with us . '' There was some laughter from the crowd , yet panic . It was probably the dumbest line I ever said . Yet something snapped in their brains . I completely destroyed their motives . There was no goal for them , no eternal life , no virgins , just my own made up heaven -- at least that 's what I hoped they were thinking . I actually had no idea and really just needed them to calm the hell down . It somehow worked . `` If I ever have to re-tell this story I am definitely going to write a better line for that , I ca n't believe they fell for this '' , I thought . I just did n't have the time now . I needed to focus . `` I will blow all of you up ! `` , I repeated as I was walking to the cockpit . Jane brought a small , harmless bomb to open the cockpit door . `` Hurry up , Jane , blow that sucker out '' , I frantically started yelling . I was totally into this . This was going to be my moment . A small explosion followed and the door to the cockpit was open . `` Shit ! `` , I yelled as I looked at the pilot . The pilot was dead . I looked to the right , looking straight into the barrel of a gun . `` I have some bad news for you '' , the co-pilot said . `` I 'm hijacking this plane '' . `` You 've got to be kidding me '' , I said . I could n't take it anymore . Something in my head just snapped and made me feel totally out of control . I grabbed the gun and his arm . `` No , you 're not '' , I said as I looked him straight into his eyes . `` I am hijacking this plane '' . The look on his face was priceless . It was as if he saw his last glimpse of hope fly out the window and get slashed in the plane engine . I told him to land the plane . I told him to find the first airfield we could land at . And , to my very own surprise , he did . He listened . He listened very well , as if there was a gun aimed at his head . Which made sense , because at that exact moment I was aiming the gun at this head . The whole situation and the nerves just made me zone out . Jane was there with me all along , she was the one that kept me on track . `` Stay clear , Jack '' , she must 've said it a hundred times . It must have been 30 minutes before I really got back to my senses . We landed at the airfield and I got completely back in control . It was time to contact the authorities . I was too excited by this . This was the moment I had been living up to for months now , and it finally reached the end . I could see the finish line , I could taste the heroism that would overcome me in the next decades . I could see the news headlines already : `` Jack and Jane hijacked a hijacked plane ''",0,4
AMT_Z2,"It was a nice day , the sun was shining and the clouds were as dark as ever . The sun was just beginning to set . I had a nice view of the city , the streets were empty , the sky was blue , and the sky itself was clear . I walked down the street , my eyes were focused on the street . I was walking , I was n't looking . I could n't see the road , I could not see anything . I did n't know what to do . I looked up at the sky , it was dark . I saw a man walking up the street and I saw him . He was dressed in a suit , the same one I had seen before . I ran over to him , I ran my hand over his face , I felt his hand . I felt the blood , the blood that was on his face . He had a gun in his hand , he was trying to kill me . He started to run . I followed him , it did n’ t take long for me to catch up to him . I got to him and I was in his face and he was looking at me with an angry look on his eyes . I started to cry . I put my hands on his shoulders and I felt him pull away from me . I pulled him into a hug , I kissed him and he looked at me and said , “ I love you. ” I was still crying . I kissed his cheek and then I felt a cold breeze hit me . It was cold . I fought it off , I had to . I took him in my arms and I held him close . I held his hand and I kissed it . I let him go and I let go of his hand as I let his arm go . I closed my eyes and I told him I loved him and that I would always love him . So I kissed the back of his head and I hugged him . His hands were cold . He kissed me back . I touched his lips and I heard him say , ‘ I love your mother . ’ I kissed my mom and I said , I love her . I woke up in my bed and I had n't eaten in a while . I loved my mom . I love my mom , I loved her . When I woke I was sitting in my room , I saw my dad , he had a handgun in his hands . He looked at my mom with a look of horror on his Face . He said , `` I love mom , you 're not my son . I told you that . I found the gun . I killed you . I have to kill you . You 're my son. ’ He said . I cried . I said I love him , but I love Mom . I hugged my mom again . I gave him a kiss . I asked him , ” Do you love mom ? ” He nodded . I smiled and I touched my mom ’ s face . I whispered , ’ She is my mother . I went to my room and I took out my phone and I called my mom to tell her that I loved you . She said , 'I love you too . I 'm sorry . I will always love you . ‘","`` Hide those cables '' , I started to get stressed . We were about to take off and Jane 's cables were in plain sight . `` They 're going to notice it '' . Jane and I started working out our plan a few months ago . We invited two companions to hijack this plane with us : Eric and Jerome . It was n't until a few months later that Eric and Jerome went their own way . They did n't value our motives , yet knew we had to do it . `` Here she goes '' , Jane said . We felt the plane driving faster . `` This is our moment , Kane , this is the moment we can make a difference '' . Our motives were simple : we had to hijack this plane to improve air security . We were fed up with all these terrorist attacks and hijacks . We had to prove it was n't going well , had to show the leaks . Even if it killed us . I got pushed back into my chair as we took off . My heart was beating faster than it ever had before . This was the day I was going to make the difference I had always wanted in life . From birth my goals was to become unforgettable .

AMT_9C,"It was a quiet night . The only sound was the steady rhythm of the rain on the windows and the soft clang of the leaves as they fell . I could hear the heavy rain coming down from the trees . I stood up and walked to the window , and opened it . The rain was still falling , but it was much heavier now . I took a deep breath and opened the window . The sky was a deep blue , the air was crisp and the moonlight glistening off of it . It was a beautiful night , and I could feel the warmth of the sun on my face . I sat down on the couch and opened my laptop and started to type . I had been working on a story about a man named Jack . It seemed like a great story , but he was a bit of a mystery to me . He was a strange man , with a dark complexion and a long , dark hair . He had a lot of hair , and a short beard . He wore a white shirt , and black pants . He did n't look like he had much of a life . He looked like he was in his early twenties . He also had a beard , but his hair was more of a dark brown . He always had a black beard , and his hair had a dark dark brown hair . It looked like it was in a bad way , but I did n’ t think it was because it was dark . It just looked like his hair . I did not know how long he had been with me , but if I could tell , he was probably in his mid twenties . I told him I was going to go to bed , and he said he would stay up late . I went to bed and I heard the rain . I woke up in the morning and looked at the clock . It read 8:25 . I got up and went to the kitchen . I made breakfast . I opened the fridge and looked over to the fridge . I saw a bottle of water in the fridge , and grabbed it . I was starting to get thirsty , so I went in to the bathroom and took a drink . I looked at my hands and saw a bloodshot eye . I knew what it meant . I grabbed a knife and a knife , and started cutting the knife into the knife . I cut myself . I wondered if I should go back to bed . I heard a noise from the kitchen , and then the door opened . A man walked in , and asked me what I was doing in the kitchen and if I was ok . I said I was fine , and that I had just finished my breakfast . He asked me to come back to the living room . I listened to him for a while , and the man said he had a story to tell . He told me about a boy who was in the house with his father , and how he had to leave and go to the hospital . He said he was sick , and wanted to be there for him . He would be there to help him . I asked him why he was going . He explained that he was being sick , but that he could n't be there because he was too sick . He then told me how he was getting better , and about how he wanted to help Jack . I thought about it for a long time , and thought about how it was a good story . I started to cry . I remembered the man I had killed , and it was the only way I could think of to explain the man who had killed me . I cried for a few minutes . I then went to sleep , and woke up . I came back to my room and went back to sleep . I watched the rain fall , and felt the warmth from the sun . I slept for a little while , then I woke . I found myself in the livingroom , and went into the kitchen to get some water . I drank some water and went out to the dining room . There was a man in a white coat , and some kind of a hat . I walked over to him , and said , “ I think I ’ m going to have to go . ”","The weather was nice at this time of year in Moscow . It was mid-summer and president Barack Hussein Obama was on a diplomatic visit in the Kreml to discuss the reduction in the two countries ' respective nuclear arsenals . Mostly , the whole thing was for show for the press , to give the media some nice photos to put on their covers . Well , their 5th or 6th pages at least . The important things were left to both countries ' military and foreign ministries . After some long speeches , standing behind podiums , the formalities were done and Obama stood next to Putin , as the two shook hands , talked and posed for the cameras . At this point , of course , Obama knew that it hardly mattered what he said . It was at this point , that something came to his mind . He had asked his Russia advisor for some phrases he could use in their language . So he said to Putin : `` You know , I have learned some things since we last met . Let me see , if I get this right . `` , and then , in broken Russian : `` [ The weather is nice ] '' . The shocked , pale face of Putin was the last thing he saw , because he had accidentaly said a predetermined save word , that the Russian head of state was given in case something went disastrously wrong . It caused a Russian secret service agent to shoot the U.S. President and put the military in high alert ( because of the retaliation that was sure to come ) , while Putin was hurriedly rushed away , constantly saying in Russian : `` No , no , this is a mistake '' . Meanwhile , the U.S. saw this as a declaration of war and started mobilizing it 's troops as well .

Hardly a decade after the withdrawal of American combat units from the first Afghan campaign – a conflict sparked by the public outcry for justice in the the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks – ethnic Uzbek and Tajik separatists in the north of the country declared themselves for Abdul Rashid Dostum , warlord of Balkh province and one of the preeminent generals of the Northern Alliance that had fought against the Taliban in the late 1990 ’ s . Unhappy with what he saw as a corrupt central government in Kabul that ignored the grievances of the northern territories while blithely exploiting its staggering mineral riches , Dostum called in his retainers and , seemingly overnight , consolidated an army of hardened fighters against the central government . Their goal , Dostum claimed , was to follow in the footsteps of the still-young Islamic Republic of Kurdistan and establish a sovereign state that had direct control over its own mineral and petroleum reserves , as well as – of course – the profits from their sale . With the growing conflict threatening Western mining interests in the region , the United States was forced to broker a ceasefire between Kabul and the separatist forces led by Dostum . I was part of the first wave of peacekeeping forces sent to the country as part of the terms of the ceasefire agreement . In return for Dostum ’ s peaceful withdrawal from the capital , Kabul agreed to administer the northern territories as a special autonomous region with its own government centered at Mazar-e-Sharif , Dostum ’ s seat of power . We were there to ensure the peaceful transition of power , and to oversee what was to become the new government ’ s first democratic elections . I was only a private then . When I wasn ’ t digging ditches or fixing radar and navigation equipment on our helicopters , I was on guard duty . I didn ’ t mind it much , really . You get a hell of a view from some of those guard towers . Now , don ’ t get me wrong . The landscape there is nothing but boring , brown , and bland on its bad days , and God knows there are plenty of those . But on its good days , it ’ s gorgeous enough to take your breath away . I remember taking my post at one of the south-facing guard towers one morning early January . It had rained all day and night before , and by the time I rolled out of my cot and made my way to my station it was cold enough that the parts of the ground that weren ’ t muddying up my boots were covered in a thin , lightly crunching layer of frost . The darkness of early morning obscured everything but the distant lights of vehicles convoying their way back to base after long overnight patrols . But when my eyes finally adjusted to the slowly growing sunlight peaking over the foothills to the east , I was mesmerized by what the light of dawn revealed . The precipitation from the day before had transformed the dull , listless range of mountains to our south – barren of anything but dried-brown dust and craggy rocks – into magnificent snow-covered massifs towering over our sprawling encampment as if to swallow us whole . “ This is what it must feel like to face a tsunami , ” I thought . The ground , which only yesterday had been painted with the same powder-brown dust that plagued the mountains , had sprouted into a thin but vibrant layer of green that spread far out in every direction until it reached the horizon or touched the base of the foothills . The short , straggly blades of grass defiantly pushing out of the frostbitten earth had appeared overnight , in the dead of winter , as if by magic . And it really was magic , every bit as much then as it is now . But this time , things are different . This time , even the magic of the Afghan landscape can do nothing to assuage the cold , prying dread and suffocating fear of what is to come . There is nothing that can ; not at this point ; not since the First Contact , and in the days that immediately followed , when – for the first time – we fully understand what it was going to cost us . This is a fitting place to make our stand . It is Afghanistan , after all – deadly as it is beautiful . This is where conquerors , gods , and empires come to die . And by this time tomorrow , I may very well add my bones to this grave . ( To Be Continued ... )",2,5

Hardly a decade after the withdrawal of American combat units from the first Afghan campaign – a conflict sparked by the public outcry for justice in the the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks – ethnic Uzbek and Tajik separatists in the north of the country declared themselves for Abdul Rashid Dostum , warlord of Balkh province and one of the preeminent generals of the Northern Alliance that had fought against the Taliban in the late 1990 ’ s . Unhappy with what he saw as a corrupt central government in Kabul that ignored the grievances of the northern territories while blithely exploiting its staggering mineral riches , Dostum called in his retainers and , seemingly overnight , consolidated an army of hardened fighters against the central government .

AMT_Z2,"Joe Warshborn pulled out a set of keys from a secret compartment in the trash can . There was hundreds of them , all tinkling and shimmering in the dim lighting . The metallic clink they made calmed his nerves . He never knew what to expect with the new villains . The keys were his weapons , though . He eyed ball the man behind the bars . Water streamed down the walls around a tall and heavy chested figure . Strong legs lounged in front of him without a care as the villain eye balled the scruffy man back . He seemed confused . `` So who are you ? '' He sneered at Joe 's janitor 's uniform , but seemed interested in the keys . They are always interested in the keys . Joe walked past their cells a hundred times , but they only seem to notice he existed when he pulled out the keys . Even then , they only pay attention to the keys . The villain 's eyes never focused on his face . Which is what Joe preferred in these type of situations . The janitor grimaced and started fiddling through the keys . He did n't often come out this way , so finding the right key took a few more seconds . His tired eyes looked up , and he scratched his scraggly beard . He held up the correct key in satisfaction so the villain could see . `` They call me The Keymaster . '' `` Are you a villain ? '' He shook my head , and quietly unlocked the heavy door . `` No , I just release them . '' `` Why ? You a hero then ? '' Joe noted the red flames shimmering almost invisible on the villain 's skin and backed away prudently . That explains why he was in the back rooms , and the walls of water . Less flammable that way . `` Nope . Just a neutral party . You are free to go , and I suggest you head out quickly . There are cameras who will notice there is a missing body . '' Joe waved vaguely towards the exit . The fire man hesitated , but freedom always took precedence with villains . Flames bursted in preparation in his hands as he jogged turn the corridor . Joe sighed and pushed his cleaning cart in the opposite direction , shaking his head in disappointment . Kids these days never said thanks anymore . The wheels squeaked pleasantly in the dim lighting and soon he heard the sirens call into the night . They knew the fire man was gone . Not his problem though . He still had to clean the guards bathroom before calling it a night , and dispose of the trash . As Joe stepped into the bathroom , he heard a polite cough from the back . One of the newer interns from The League of Awesome Heroes stood awkwardly next to the stalls . Joe stopped , and looked expectedly at him . The young hero posed dramatically . `` Uhm , good citizen ! Are you the man known as Keymaster ? '' Joe glanced around the empty bathroom , down at his janitors uniform , and back at the awkwardly confident man . `` I can neither confirm nor deny that . '' This seemed to deflate the hero 's enthusiasm . `` Oh , well , okay . I have a package for you . The Keymaster . Which is you . Right ? '' The janitor shrugged amicably and held out his hand , `` Let 's just say I am not surprised to see you here . '' With a sniff , the hero dumped the package down onto Joe 's wrinkled palm and unceremoniously dove out the window . Joe carefully weighed the package , and nodded approvingly . Another two years of this , he should be able to retire . With a whistle , the Keymaster began mopping down the floors .","High above the Broken Lands , knights of the sky fought their dance of death . Seated in the open cockpit of his Holland & Sons FE-3b *Lancer , * Commander Richard Turpin had a god 's eye view of the air battle . Off towards the western side of the struggle could be seen the fleeing convoy of merchantmen , their coal fed steam engines sending plumes of black smoke high into the sky . A few revenue cutters , taken out of mothball and outfitted with extra armor and guns shepherded their charges like loyal guard dogs , ringing the steamers and their precious cargo . One cutter was already sinking , a deadly black wound in its side . A flight of bombers had skimmed over the water and released their payload of torpedoes . The cutter 's captain , his name unknown to Turpin had ordered his ship between the wake of the torpedoes and his charges . He took one meant for an oil tanker the Duchy could scarce afford to lose . Turpin saluted him for his bravery . Just below him Falcon and Griffon Squadrons were fighting in a massive furball against the convoy 's attackers . The foe 's insignia was unknown to Turpin , depicting a cloaked skeleton holding both scythe and hour-glass . A mercenary unit , same as his . An enemy biplane tried to loop behind Captain Kellerman 's *Sparrowhawk , but the veteran pilot refused it , cutting back on the throttle and shredding excess speed . The biplane fell right under Kellerman 's sights , his three machine guns shredding the heavier machine from nose to tail . First the bullets flashed bright as they hit the engine , then they splashed red from the pilot 's blood . The sound of the lead rounds stitching through taunt canvas was like the roll of a snare drum . Escorted by his pair of wingmates , Turpin 's Command Triple had little to fear at six thousand meters . The air was thin , and even under the thick layers of wool and flying leathers he could feel the icy bite of the wind . There . Flying at perhaps four thousand meters and moving towards the ships , a pair of enemy bombers . Wiggling his wings to attract the attention of his comrades Tuprin pointed towards their prey . Gesturing that they understood , Turpin leaned his stick forwards and to the left , spilling down and towards their target . His altimeter spun down as he hurtled towards the ground , his speedometer ticking steadily upwards . *170 ... 175 ... 180 ... * The lumbering two-seaters never had a chance . One of them , crewed by a more observant rear gunner , opened up , his tracings stitching an orange stream across the sky . None of them flew near Turpin whose ears were deafened by the roar of his engine and whistling wind . The lead bomber fell under his sights . No . Closer . The second gunner opened up , the paths of their bullets crossing one another as they fired up at the descending triple . Turpin 's vision was completely filled with the sight of his target . He saw everything , the lozenge pattern camouflage , the rear gunner with tinted goggles and white scarf trying to reload his weapon , the black cough of their in-line engines ... Now . Turpin 's twin 7.7mm machines answered to his commands , spitting violet tracers and invisible lead down onto his prey . There was no way he could miss , each bullet finding its way towards the enemy plane . The rear gunner 's head vanished in a spray of red mist , his body slumping over his gun . The engine caught fire and began to engulf the cockpit and although he knew it to be impossible , Turpin swore he heard the enemy pilot screaming . And just like that he was past , turning back towards the sky to regain precious altitude . His kill fell in a blazing inferno , a cloud of acrid smoke billowing in its wake . The other bomber tumbled from the sky like a broken bird , its right wing shattered in two . It was Turpin third kill of the day .",4,5

He did n't often come out this way , so finding the right key took a few more seconds . His tired eyes looked up , and he scratched his scraggly beard . He held up the correct key in satisfaction so the villain could see . `` They call me The Keymaster . '' `` Are you a villain ? '' He shook my head , and quietly unlocked the heavy door . `` No , I just release them . '' `` Why ? You a hero then ? '' Joe noted the red flames shimmering almost invisible on the villain 's skin and backed away prudently . That explains why he was in the back rooms , and the walls of water . Less flammable that way . `` Nope . Just a neutral party . You are free to go , and I suggest you head out quickly . There are cameras who will notice there is a missing body . '' Joe waved vaguely towards the exit . The fire man hesitated , but freedom always took precedence with villains . Flames bursted in preparation in his hands as he jogged turn the corridor . Joe sighed and pushed his cleaning cart in the opposite direction , shaking his head in disappointment . Kids these days never said thanks anymore . The wheels squeaked pleasantly in the dim lighting and soon he heard the sirens call into the night . They knew the fire man was gone . Not his problem though . He still had to clean the guards bathroom before calling it a night , and dispose of the trash . As Joe stepped into the bathroom , he heard a polite cough from the back . One of the newer interns from The League of Awesome Heroes stood awkwardly next to the stalls . Joe stopped , and looked expectedly at him . The young hero posed dramatically . `` Uhm , good citizen ! Are you the man known as Keymaster ? '' Joe glanced around the empty bathroom , down at his janitors uniform , and back at the awkwardly confident man . `` I can neither confirm nor deny that . '' This seemed to deflate the hero 's enthusiasm . `` Oh , well , okay . I have a package for you . The Keymaster . Which is you . Right ? '' The janitor shrugged amicably and held out his hand , `` Let 's just say I am not surprised to see you here . '' With a sniff , the hero dumped the package down onto Joe 's wrinkled palm and unceremoniously dove out the window . Joe carefully weighed the package , and nodded approvingly . Another two years of this , he should be able to retire . With a whistle , the Keymaster began mopping down the floors .","High above the Broken Lands , knights of the sky fought their dance of death . Seated in the open cockpit of his Holland & Sons FE-3b *Lancer , * Commander Richard Turpin had a god 's eye view of the air battle . Off towards the western side of the struggle could be seen the fleeing convoy of merchantmen , their coal fed steam engines sending plumes of black smoke high into the sky . A few revenue cutters , taken out of mothball and outfitted with extra armor and guns shepherded their charges like loyal guard dogs , ringing the steamers and their precious cargo . One cutter was already sinking , a deadly black wound in its side . A flight of bombers had skimmed over the water and released their payload of torpedoes . The cutter 's captain , his name unknown to Turpin had ordered his ship between the wake of the torpedoes and his charges . He took one meant for an oil tanker the Duchy could scarce afford to lose . Turpin saluted him for his bravery . Just below him Falcon and Griffon Squadrons were fighting in a massive furball against the convoy 's attackers . The foe 's insignia was unknown to Turpin , depicting a cloaked skeleton holding both scythe and hour-glass . A mercenary unit , same as his . An enemy biplane tried to loop behind Captain Kellerman 's *Sparrowhawk , but the veteran pilot refused it , cutting back on the throttle and shredding excess speed . The biplane fell right under Kellerman 's sights , his three machine guns shredding the heavier machine from nose to tail . First the bullets flashed bright as they hit the engine , then they splashed red from the pilot 's blood . The sound of the lead rounds stitching through taunt canvas was like the roll of a snare drum . Escorted by his pair of wingmates , Turpin 's Command Triple had little to fear at six thousand meters . The air was thin , and even under the thick layers of wool and flying leathers he could feel the icy bite of the wind . There . Flying at perhaps four thousand meters and moving towards the ships , a pair of enemy bombers . Wiggling his wings to attract the attention of his comrades Tuprin pointed towards their prey . Gesturing that they understood , Turpin leaned his stick forwards and to the left , spilling down and towards their target . His altimeter spun down as he hurtled towards the ground , his speedometer ticking steadily upwards . *170 ... 175 ... 180 ... * The lumbering two-seaters never had a chance . One of them , crewed by a more observant rear gunner , opened up , his tracings stitching an orange stream across the sky . None of them flew near Turpin whose ears were deafened by the roar of his engine and whistling wind . The lead bomber fell under his sights . No . Closer . The second gunner opened up , the paths of their bullets crossing one another as they fired up at the descending triple . Turpin 's vision was completely filled with the sight of his target . He saw everything , the lozenge pattern camouflage , the rear gunner with tinted goggles and white scarf trying to reload his weapon , the black cough of their in-line engines ... Now . Turpin 's twin 7.7mm machines answered to his commands , spitting violet tracers and invisible lead down onto his prey . There was no way he could miss , each bullet finding its way towards the enemy plane . The rear gunner 's head vanished in a spray of red mist , his body slumping over his gun . The engine caught fire and began to engulf the cockpit and although he knew it to be impossible , Turpin swore he heard the enemy pilot screaming . And just like that he was past , turning back towards the sky to regain precious altitude . His kill fell in a blazing inferno , a cloud of acrid smoke billowing in its wake . The other bomber tumbled from the sky like a broken bird , its right wing shattered in two . It was Turpin third kill of the day .",4,5

AMT_4Y,"My name is Robert Van Witt . Everyone calls me Robbie but I wish they ’ d call me Rob . I don ’ t correct them anymore because when I would , it ’ s like they didn ’ t hear . I ’ m trudging up a hill to my buddy Tyler ’ s birthday party . I don ’ t really want to go . He ’ s turning 16 , same age as me . I ’ d be pedaling this incline but my bike is out of commission . It ’ s not a long story . Basically I ’ m a target . I don ’ t fight back . The insecure pick on me ; the secure could care less . So it ’ s like victimless . Last Wednesday Brandon snatched my bike from my hands , hefted it way up , bellowed , “ This is Sparta ! ” and heaved it into the wall . Now the front rim ’ s all bent . What gets me though is people laughed at a botched reference . But if I ’ d biked I ’ d get sweaty and when I sweat I stink . Any deodorant I use starts to smell like me , or I start to smell like it , or something ’ s off . Either way it all reeks . It ’ s bad enough when my shirt soaks through and makes me wince when I sit back against a chair but I can live with that . It ’ s when I sweat and I start to smell really bad , or worse yet when I suspect that I may but I just can ’ t tell . I ’ m convinced every time a girl puts on lotion it ’ s to cover my odor . I ’ ve got this sick habit , a compulsion really , where I feel that I reek all the f ’ in time . Well when I ’ m around people . I think it ’ s me focusing my anxiety on something physical , explainable . So I ’ m always retreating to the toilet , which reeks , to check my pits , which reek , to reapply speed stick , which reeks less . You don ’ t want to know how many bars I go through . I order them in bulk , let ’ s leave it at that . The thing about the socially anxious , is that we are not wholly convinced of our inferiority . Well , that I assume , as I make it a point to avoid those who remind me of myself . But I believe we are not wholly convinced of our inferiority . We recognize it at times , strongly at times . But there is a certain awareness , an innate intelligence necessary to recognize this . The dull do not know they are incompetent . Let me clear this up . I hate myself . I believe I am a god . I loathe and love myself ; the love is more distant . I am at once fearful and prideful . Ashamed and arrogant . These beliefs are separate but linked , like joined rings . I make it to Tyler ’ s at the top of the hill . The Ryan ’ s and Will are headed this way but about a block off . I don ’ t think they see me but I avert my gaze anyway . The clouds in the sky are rows of cotton . Sometimes I feel like a slave . I don ’ t knock I just walk right in . I ’ m family here Tyler ’ s mom says but I don ’ t feel it . Or maybe like the one guy who doesn ’ t speak at the reunions . There ’ s nobody here . All in the backyard , something dissonant is trailing through the screen door , that means Abdur is here , the self-appointed dj at all gatherings . I hate entrances . I make for the bathroom . “ Robbie ! ” it ’ s Kim , she ’ s inches from my face . I jump . “ You ’ re so oblivious ! ” she ’ s smiling with both rows of chompers . This kind of offends me . I ’ m highly observant it ’ s just I get overwhelmed . “ Sorry , ” I offer . “ Don ’ t get mad , maybe just look where you ’ re going. ” it creeps me out when she smiles like this . She doesn ’ t have dead eyes or a weird twitch or anything , it ’ s just so much face to take in . “ I ’ m so happy you ’ re finally here. ” yeah , well I ’ m not . “ Here I want to show you something , ” She grabs my hand . This girl is always trying to jump my bones and she isn ’ t shy about it . “ Actually I got ta take a leak. ” “ No you don ’ t . And you smell fine. ” “ Uh , ” “ C ’ mon , ” she drags me into Tyler ’ s bedroom and pushes me onto the bed , closing the door behind us . “ Check this out , ” she ’ s showing me a photo on her phone , it ’ s real out-of- focus . “ Oh , neat. ” “ Yeah I just got her this morning. ” “ I didn ’ t know you liked rats. ” “ She ’ s a Pomeranian ! ” “ Oh , yeah , I can see that. ” She ’ s giving me this sidelong stare . Eye contact I struggle with . I can ’ t remember how long it ’ s been this way . “ So…IshouldgofindTyler. ” at least I didn ’ t stutter , “ Ok seeya ! ” She clasps my shoulder , firmly . She ’ s a rock climber . She ’ s still giving me this stare . I think she thinks it ’ s sexy , smoky . She leans in close . I feel like I ’ m in traction . She ’ s whispering in my ear , hot and wet . I ’ m having a lot of trouble focusing on what she ’ s saying . I know I ’ m getting red . All I can think is I pray that no one walks in . “ Hey you know what ? It ’ s the damndest thing , ” yes I talk like this . “ I just remembered my Grandma ’ s in the hospital , yeah bad UTI , and I promised my mom I ’ d call her and she takes her afternoon nap at three and would you look at the time ! ” I sort of duck and twist under her arm to extricate myself . “ No she isn ’ t . Why are you so nervous ? ” Because last time you squeezed my sack so hard I almost cried . “ Nervous ? Me ? ” “ Fine , ” she ’ s got her arms crossed looking stony-eyed , like through me , “ And you don ’ t even want to go to the movies tomorrow…remind me again why we ’ re even a thing ? ” “ What ? Yes I do ! I ’ ll text you. ” I skedaddle out of there and beeline for the toilet . When I make it outside I see , thank God , we ’ re not all sitting around the table . It ’ s a clean crowd for the most part and they ’ re sugar buzzed . Will and Sarah are jumping on the tramp and the Ryan ’ s , Jim , Kari , Kevin , and Megan are playing basketball .

AMT_UR,"My name is Robert Van Witt . Everyone calls me Robbie but I wish they ’ d call me Rob . I don ’ t correct them anymore because when I would , it ’ s like they didn ’ t hear . I ’ m trudging up a hill to my buddy Tyler ’ s birthday party . I don ’ t really want to go . He ’ s turning 16 , same age as me . I ’ d be pedaling this incline but my bike is out of commission . It ’ s not a long story . Basically I ’ m a target . I don ’ t fight back . The insecure pick on me ; the secure could care less . So it ’ s like victimless . Last Wednesday Brandon snatched my bike from my hands , hefted it way up , bellowed , “ This is Sparta ! ” and heaved it into the wall . Now the front rim ’ s all bent . What gets me though is people laughed at a botched reference . But if I ’ d biked I ’ d get sweaty and when I sweat I stink . Any deodorant I use starts to smell like me , or I start to smell like it , or something ’ s off . Either way it all reeks . It ’ s bad enough when my shirt soaks through and makes me wince when I sit back against a chair but I can live with that . It ’ s when I sweat and I start to smell really bad , or worse yet when I suspect that I may but I just can ’ t tell . I ’ m convinced every time a girl puts on lotion it ’ s to cover my odor . I ’ ve got this sick habit , a compulsion really , where I feel that I reek all the f ’ in time . Well when I ’ m around people . I think it ’ s me focusing my anxiety on something physical , explainable . So I ’ m always retreating to the toilet , which reeks , to check my pits , which reek , to reapply speed stick , which reeks less . You don ’ t want to know how many bars I go through . I order them in bulk , let ’ s leave it at that . The thing about the socially anxious , is that we are not wholly convinced of our inferiority . Well , that I assume , as I make it a point to avoid those who remind me of myself . But I believe we are not wholly convinced of our inferiority . We recognize it at times , strongly at times . But there is a certain awareness , an innate intelligence necessary to recognize this . The dull do not know they are incompetent . Let me clear this up . I hate myself . I believe I am a god . I loathe and love myself ; the love is more distant . I am at once fearful and prideful . Ashamed and arrogant . These beliefs are separate but linked , like joined rings . I make it to Tyler ’ s at the top of the hill . The Ryan ’ s and Will are headed this way but about a block off . I don ’ t think they see me but I avert my gaze anyway . The clouds in the sky are rows of cotton . Sometimes I feel like a slave . I don ’ t knock I just walk right in . I ’ m family here Tyler ’ s mom says but I don ’ t feel it . Or maybe like the one guy who doesn ’ t speak at the reunions . There ’ s nobody here . All in the backyard , something dissonant is trailing through the screen door , that means Abdur is here , the self-appointed dj at all gatherings . I hate entrances . I make for the bathroom . “ Robbie ! ” it ’ s Kim , she ’ s inches from my face . I jump . “ You ’ re so oblivious ! ” she ’ s smiling with both rows of chompers . This kind of offends me . I ’ m highly observant it ’ s just I get overwhelmed . “ Sorry , ” I offer . “ Don ’ t get mad , maybe just look where you ’ re going. ” it creeps me out when she smiles like this . She doesn ’ t have dead eyes or a weird twitch or anything , it ’ s just so much face to take in . “ I ’ m so happy you ’ re finally here. ” yeah , well I ’ m not . “ Here I want to show you something , ” She grabs my hand . This girl is always trying to jump my bones and she isn ’ t shy about it . “ Actually I got ta take a leak. ” “ No you don ’ t .

AMT_Z2,"My name is Robert Van Witt . Everyone calls me Robbie but I wish they ’ d call me Rob . I don ’ t correct them anymore because when I would , it ’ s like they didn ’ t hear . I ’ m trudging up a hill to my buddy Tyler ’ s birthday party . I don ’ t really want to go . He ’ s turning 16 , same age as me . I ’ d be pedaling this incline but my bike is out of commission . It ’ s not a long story . Basically I ’ m a target . I don ’ t fight back . The insecure pick on me ; the secure could care less . So it ’ s like victimless . Last Wednesday Brandon snatched my bike from my hands , hefted it way up , bellowed , “ This is Sparta ! ” and heaved it into the wall . Now the front rim ’ s all bent . What gets me though is people laughed at a botched reference . But if I ’ d biked I ’ d get sweaty and when I sweat I stink . Any deodorant I use starts to smell like me , or I start to smell like it , or something ’ s off . Either way it all reeks . It ’ s bad enough when my shirt soaks through and makes me wince when I sit back against a chair but I can live with that . It ’ s when I sweat and I start to smell really bad , or worse yet when I suspect that I may but I just can ’ t tell . I ’ m convinced every time a girl puts on lotion it ’ s to cover my odor . I ’ ve got this sick habit , a compulsion really , where I feel that I reek all the f ’ in time . Well when I ’ m around people . I think it ’ s me focusing my anxiety on something physical , explainable . So I ’ m always retreating to the toilet , which reeks , to check my pits , which reek , to reapply speed stick , which reeks less . You don ’ t want to know how many bars I go through . I order them in bulk , let ’ s leave it at that . The thing about the socially anxious , is that we are not wholly convinced of our inferiority . Well , that I assume , as I make it a point to avoid those who remind me of myself . But I believe we are not wholly convinced of our inferiority . We recognize it at times , strongly at times . But there is a certain awareness , an innate intelligence necessary to recognize this . The dull do not know they are incompetent . Let me clear this up . I hate myself . I believe I am a god . I loathe and love myself ; the love is more distant . I am at once fearful and prideful . Ashamed and arrogant . These beliefs are separate but linked , like joined rings . I make it to Tyler ’ s at the top of the hill . The Ryan ’ s and Will are headed this way but about a block off . I don ’ t think they see me but I avert my gaze anyway . The clouds in the sky are rows of cotton . Sometimes I feel like a slave . I don ’ t knock I just walk right in . I ’ m family here Tyler ’ s mom says but I don ’ t feel it . Or maybe like the one guy who doesn ’ t speak at the reunions . There ’ s nobody here . All in the backyard , something dissonant is trailing through the screen door , that means Abdur is here , the self-appointed dj at all gatherings . I hate entrances . I make for the bathroom . “ Robbie ! ” it ’ s Kim , she ’ s inches from my face . I jump . “ You ’ re so oblivious ! ” she ’ s smiling with both rows of chompers . This kind of offends me . I ’ m highly observant it ’ s just I get overwhelmed . “ Sorry , ” I offer . “ Don ’ t get mad , maybe just look where you ’ re going. ” it creeps me out when she smiles like this . She doesn ’ t have dead eyes or a weird twitch or anything , it ’ s just so much face to take in . “ I ’ m so happy you ’ re finally here. ” yeah , well I ’ m not . “ Here I want to show you something , ” She grabs my hand . This girl is always trying to jump my bones and she isn ’ t shy about it . “ Actually I got ta take a leak. ” “ No you don ’ t . And you smell fine. ” “ Uh , ” “ C ’ mon , ” she drags me into Tyler ’ s bedroom and pushes me onto the bed , closing the door behind us . “ Check this out , ” she ’ s showing me a photo on her phone , it ’ s real out-of- focus . “ Oh , neat. ” “ Yeah I just got her this morning. ” “ I didn ’ t know you liked rats. ” “ She ’ s a Pomeranian ! ” “ Oh , yeah , I can see that. ” She ’ s giving me this sidelong stare . Eye contact I struggle with . I can ’ t remember how long it ’ s been this way . “ So…IshouldgofindTyler. ” at least I didn ’ t stutter , “ Ok seeya ! ” She clasps my shoulder , firmly . She ’ s a rock climber . She ’ s still giving me this stare . I think she thinks it ’ s sexy , smoky . She leans in close . I feel like I ’ m in traction . She ’ s whispering in my ear , hot and wet . I ’ m having a lot of trouble focusing on what she ’ s saying . I know I ’ m getting red . All I can think is I pray that no one walks in . “ Hey you know what ? It ’ s the damndest thing , ” yes I talk like this . “ I just remembered my Grandma ’ s in the hospital , yeah bad UTI , and I promised my mom I ’ d call her and she takes her afternoon nap at three and would you look at the time ! ” I sort of duck and twist under her arm to extricate myself . “ No she isn ’ t . Why are you so nervous ? ” Because last time you squeezed my sack so hard I almost cried . “ Nervous ? Me ? ” “ Fine , ” she ’ s got her arms crossed looking stony-eyed , like through me , “ And you don ’ t even want to go to the movies tomorrow…remind me again why we ’ re even a thing ? ” “ What ? Yes I do ! I ’ ll text you. ” I skedaddle out of there and beeline for the toilet . When I make it outside I see , thank God , we ’ re not all sitting around the table . It ’ s a clean crowd for the most part and they ’ re sugar buzzed . Will and Sarah are jumping on the tramp and the Ryan ’ s , Jim , Kari , Kevin , and Megan are playing basketball . Tyler and Abdur are sitting in plastic lawn chairs by the stereo passing a vaporizer . “ Robbie ! ” “ Why hello there gents , ” “ Pull up a seat , catch up , ” Abdur goes to pass me the MLFB . “ No thanks , ” I can only partake in private , or social interaction goes from nerve wracking to excruciating . “ Suit yourself , ” Abdur ’ s wearing shades , the Visine only goes so far . “ You seen Kim ? ” Tyler asks , “ She said she was coming. ” “ Uh , no. ” The sun ’ s in my eyes . “ She ambushed you inside ? ” Tyler ’ s smiling . “ You need to just be straight with her man , ” Abdur is gon na make for a great life-coach someday . “ I know… ” “ Your problem is you try so hard to please everyone , you don ’ t think about yourself . And when you do that , you ’ re cheating them . Well I mean not Kim , she feeds on that but- ” “ Tell me about it. ” “ Look buddy , I know exactly how you feel , ” Abdur raises his shades and wants to have like a man to man moment . Goddamnit . “ You feel like you have to make people happy , comfortable . Well you can ’ t man . You literally can not worry about that . When you try so hard you ’ re doing the opposite – you ’ re putting people on edge . They can tell . We can tell , ” He waggles a hitchhiker ’ s thumb between himself and Tyler , “ I used to be like you man , so worried all the time about what people think . But here ’ s the thing – you can ’ t do an effin thing about it . People want the real you man , not like this persona you try so hard to portray . I know because that was me . And believe me , when you ’ re brown in a town like this people stare . But you just got ta straighten up , brush it off , tell yourself you have the same right as anyone else to be here . Look , I had it bad and I got over that sh*t. If I could there ’ s no reason you can ’ t. ” “ …I know , ” my head ’ s declined , I ’ m shaking it in solemn agreement . “ No you don ’ t ! See this is exactly what I ’ m talking about . You ’ re agreeing with me but you aren ’ t really . Tell me to f**k off ! Don ’ t be a people pleaser ! ” “ Hey you got any SpaceApe on there ? ” thank you Tyler . “ Kode9 , hell yeah ! ” The sun ’ s frying me like an egg on blacktop . “ I got ta take a pisser , ” “ Sure , ” The party ’ s really winding down now . They were splitting cake around the table when I was headed back out earlier and I pretended like I forgot my present for Tyler at home . I walked a couple blocks down the hill to the park and sat myself on a bench and smoked a Marb light and hated myself for it . It ’ s pathetic and I know it . “ Tyler , this is for you. ” “ Thanks buddy ! Okay , let me guess , ” he shakes the package with a wry grin . “ Blue Velvet. ” “ How… ” “ You must ’ ve hinted at it last week or something . Hey Rob , I ’ m glad you could make it . Really , it means a lot. ” “ Of course my dude ! Just can ’ t believe I forgot your present at home . Missed the cake , ” “ Yeah . So we still doubling tomorrow ? ” On the way back , kicking myself in penitence , I sigh and look skyward . The clouds are gossamer now , like gauze I think .","When Artigan saw the a wisp of smoke rise from the forest cover , the chill that went through his spine had nothing to do with the hint of coming snow in the air . He picked up the pace and walked toward the source of the smoke . Was it another hiker ? Or maybe two ? The evening air suddenly felt more alive , almost electric . The anticipation made his mouth water and the shivering feeling in his stomach made it difficult for him to breathe . He was feeling giddy with the prospect of a kill on the hill . The garotte in his pocket was like a living thing and he patted it with a loving touch . `` Soon , my lovely . Soon . '' When he reached the fire , he was slightly disappointed to see it was just one man instead of two . For a moment he wondered who the hell treks alone . But then he realized that he was trekking alone too . `` Hey , hello there , '' Artigan said to the man who sat on a log with his back toward him . The man did n't move . He just kept his hands extended towards the fire . `` Hello , Artigan . Please join me . '' Artigan paused . The man knew his name . Which meant the man knew about him and what he did . Artigan thought about his choices , he could turn and go back where he had come from or he could join the man and find out how he knew his name before slicing his head off and eating his brain . His curiosity got the best of him and he walked up to the small fire . The man looked up to him and Artigan saw that his face was criss crossed with scars . Jagged wounds that had long healed but left their marks . When the man smiled , his pointed canines shone like diamonds in the semi darkness . Artigan felt a strange mixture of revulsion , lust and happiness in his chest . This was no one else but The Cross . The famous serial killer who crossed the faces of his victims after killing them . Artigan was not only a fan of the man but he positively idolized him . And he knew Artigan 's name ! And now Artigan had the opportunity to take his idol 's head ! Could this evening get any better ? He extended his hand towards the man who had earned a reputation based on unrivaled violence in the serial killer community . He was almost the level of a senior . A legend ! `` Sir , big big fan of your work . You 've been a true inspiration for my work . '' The man did n't take his hand . `` But , you , Artigan , you 've been a disgrace to our community . It 's people like you who give our work a bad name . '' Shit , thought Artigan as the man clasped his hand in his iron grip and a flash of steel from his other hand swung towards Artigan 's face . He flinched and that saved his life . The trademark serrated knife in Cross ' hand nearly scrapped through his eyeball . He had the garotte out in a flash , and he swung the weighed end around the other man 's neck . The choking sound he heard meant he had looped perfectly and now it was all about raw strength . He pulled the wire and Cross freed his hand to try and get his fingers under the garotte . But his other hand still had the knife and now he was also closer to Artigan . The knife flashed again and again in the falling darkness , and Artigan felt the sharp bite of the blade on his neck , face and chest . Blood filled his mouth but he managed to grab the other end of the garotte . He pulled and sliced with all his might and felt the wire bite into the flesh and tissue of the neck . The sharp tang of blood filled his nostrils , the same familiar feeling he had enjoyed so many times before . But his strength was fading . cross still jabbed at him with the wicked knife but his jabs had lost the will behind them . The two killers fell on the ground as fatigue and blood loss caught up with them . The first snow of winter started to fall and Artigan smiled at the numbness that was spreading through his body . He had had his kill . That was all that mattered .",3,5

AMT_KG,"Overall the idea is solid , and the style fits the plot . It has the feel of a fairy-tale with its narrative style . There are a few things I noticed right off the bat . In the first paragraph you used the word `` poor '' four times in three sentences . I would suggest maybe varying it , > He lived in the poor part of the city , for he was poor . He made clothes for poor workers , and was paid very little for even his best work . He was poor , but he was happy . An alternative could be : * He lived in the slums of the city , for he was hard on money . He made clothes for workers like him , and was paid very little even for his best work . He was poor , but he was happy . * If you change your words every so often it keeps the reader 's interest that little bit longer . I notice that you use the word `` poor '' a few more times in the story , so try playing around with vocabulary each time . In your third paragraph , you use parenthesis . This is n't a bad thing , but in most stories , one would try to avoid using them . I would try incorporating it into the story , so instead of > He was so extremely tired when he went into his bedroom ( which was just above his shop ) , but as soon as he lay down , he immediately felt wide awake . You could say : *He was so extremely tired when he went to his room above the shop* I found this sentence awkward in a few other ways as well . The phrasing `` he was so extremely tired '' leaves me expecting the continuation * ... that [ blank ] happened* . It would be a good idea to either split the sentence in two or change *He was so extremely tired* to *He felt his exhaustion* . The sentence would feel smoother that way as you lead into the *but as soon as he lay down* . There are a few more sentences that bug me , but I ca n't quite put my finger on them . A saw one that was borderline a run-on sentence in your last paragraph ( *No ... In reality , he was Mr. Alexander Black* ) As a few last notes , I would probably expand the paragraph with the dream . In both your intro and concluding paragraph you bring back the idea of food , shelter and warmth . The first time with him being content with his meager lifestyle , the second time with what was once satisfactory not being enough anymore . I like the shift from the positive to downcast , but the dream with the fine red and gold cloak does n't quite fit the theme that you established . So , if possible , try to bring the idea of food , shelter and warmth into the dream . What did the king eat that was better ? How was the king 's bed better ? How was the fireplace better ? Answering these questions would make a greater contrast to his life and tie the dream into the rest of the story a bit better . It would certainly explain why the tailor woke up and suddenly was n't satisfied with his way of life anymore . I hope this critique is n't too harsh . Like I said , you 've got a solid story . If you make any changes ( even if they are n't my suggestions because let 's be honest , I 'm no expert ) , let me know . I 'll be happy to read it again .","`` Do it , coward , '' the voice in his head urges . And he does . Suddenly , he is thrown into another world . He sees himself , walking , shaking hands , receiving his papers , walking away in deep blue robes and laughing in victory . He sneers and then is ripped away , swirling , lost in color as a new scene comes into focus . A woman . Long , brunette hair . High cheek bones . Deep blue eyes the color of the Aegean in spring . The woman giggles , laughing at some unheard joke . He ca n't help but smile ... `` Who ... '' The world spins and he is torn away again , This time to a storm in a forest . The drumming of the rain drowns out all other sound . Another man is yelling , but ca n't be heard . Suddenly the voice cuts through the wet splashing . `` RUN . '' He follows the man 's instructions , a sense of overwhelming dread flowing over him . An unnoticeable tree stump grabs a hold of his foot , hurling him into the mud . This is the end . He ca n't bear it . Just as the dread is about to drown him he flashes to another scene . The woman is there , and the yelling man too . `` What ... '' `` Bout time you woke up ! '' The woman giggles and he feels the smile bubbling to his face again . He jumps forward . The woman is still there , but older now . Lines have appeared in her forehead , as well as curves around her mouth and little crinkles next to her eyes . Still , she retains all of her beauty . `` We 're going to be late for the graduation ! '' Now she is lying in a bed . Beep . She wears nothing but a robe . Beep . Much older now , the lines are thicker . And her hair is grey . There are strange machines around , a symphony of beeps and clicks and whirs and wooshes . Beep . People outside the room seem busy , rushing to and fro . Beep . `` It does n't hurt , '' she croaks quietly . She closes her eyes , as the beeps grow further apart . Beep . She mutters something else , `` I ... . love ... you . '' ... ... ... ... a tear rolls from his eye as he realizes the mistake he has made . `` NO ! '' he screams , but it is too late . The gun clicks .",5,4

AMT_KG,"Taylor rushed past the hordes of reporters that lined the pathways of the spacious university campus . She dashed in and out between the teams of reporters preparing to go live in a matter of minutes , without causing a second glance in her direction . It felt like a lifetime since the news had been made public , when in reality , the leak had gone live two hours ago . No one quite knew of what to make of the news . How could anyone react to realization that we had never been the only ones in the universe ? To make matters even more puzzling , the fish like sentient creature had been discovered right in our solar system- right on Jupiter ’ s own Europa . Before Taylor even had time to make any sense of the news , she had received a call from her boss to rush directly to the “ stage ” as he liked to call his prep room for the presidential debates . When Taylor finally pushed her way to the locked classroom door , she knocked twice and entered the dark room to find her boss hunched over a nightlight and a humidifier . “ Taylor have you heard ? ” He asked without looking up from the light . She nodded . “ I have . Now what ? ” The year was 2020 and the presidential election was being hyped up more than ever before . Nobody in a thousand years could have ever predicted the outcome of the 2016 election . With only ten days to go before the general election , Hillary Clinton , after being fed up with Trump ’ s sexist remarks , challenged Trump to a bake-off . If Trump could bake a better devil ’ s food cake , then she would renounce her bid for the presidency . Much to everyone ’ s surprise , the guy could bake some of the best cake anyone could ever have . However , to no one ’ s surprise , when Donald Trump entered the presidency , he shrugged off his idea to build a giant wall and focused his attention of expanding the space program . Drawing money from his own personal fortune , Donald Trump turned the United States space program into the best in the world . When asked why he cared so much about space exploration , typical Trump would respond that he wanted to have another option in case those damn Muslim terrorist blew up the Earth . Everyone had always assumed that Trump would run for reelection , but he insisted that he didn ’ t intend to stay in office for more than four years . Now , if people thought that Trump running for president was crazy that was nothing to what the 2020 presidential candidates were . Sure some were extremely well qualified , but others , let ’ s just say no one ever considered would be running . Among those was rapper Kanye West , who ran with the Democrat party . Somehow , he rose to the top of the polls , and before anyone could say are we really doing this again , another entertainer became a contender for the white house . Nobody for the life of them could figure out how they got Kanye West vs Sarah Palin 2020 . Taylor snapped the compact mirror shut and tossed it into her tote before looking at the man sitting across from her on the private jet as they flew straight towards the Hollywood Hills . He was dressed in an immaculate black tux , a new look for him . She stayed quiet as she waited for the man to speak . After all , he had called her and she wasn ’ t one to speak unless spoken to . After a brief moment of silence , the rapper cleared his throat and tapped his hand on the table . “ Taylor , I understand that we haven ’ t been on speaking terms of as lately , but I need your help. ” Taylor stayed silent and feigned disinterest as she turned her head to look at the dozens of aquariums scattered throughout the plane . “ As you ’ ve probably heard , I ’ m running for president in 2020 and I ’ ve got a serious problem . I ’ ve done a fair bit of polls and research on my end and it appears I might have this election in the bag . I need you to make sure it stays that way. ” Taylor laughs and shakes her head . “ What do you need me for . You can hire the very best campaign manager money can buy . I don ’ t have any political experience and quite frankly I could care less about this type of stuff. ” “ That ’ s true , but you are the very best at keeping people ’ s attention . I want you to make sure that the public continues to pay attention as I lay low for a while . And perhaps maybe even stir up some dirt on Palin while you ’ re at it . I can assure you that you will be very justly rewarded for this. ” Kanye folds his fingers on top of each other and stares in Taylor ’ s direction . “ Why would you stay low at a time like this. ” “ Let ’ s just say Mr. Trump is onto something huge that I have a personal stake in . Now , do we have a deal or not ? ” Taylor laughs and begins to stand up from her seat before Kanye grabs her hand and holds her in place . “ I can help make them pay . All of those guys who left you without a second glance in your direction won ’ t have the last word . After all , everyone assumes that Guantanamo shut down , and who ’ s to say that is or is not true . Paper work gets lost all the time and sometimes try as we might stuff happens by accident. ” Kanye smiles at the last bit . Taylor looks over at Kanye and sits back down . Perhaps she could listen , if only for just a second . “ Taylor , I need you to get the word out. ” Kanye half whispers . Taylor frowns in confusion . “ This is weird , I ’ m going to turn the lights on , ” she says . Before Kanye can stop her , Taylor flips the light switch on . She stifles a scream as she realizes that she is surrounded by hundreds if not thousands of fish bowls with fish floating in them . Right in front of her , Kanye is dressed in an aqua metallic wet suit . “ What ’ s going on ? ” She manages to get out . Kanye smiles and outstretches his hands . “ Don ’ t you understand Swift ; this recent discovery has helped me come to terms with who I am . It ’ s time that everyone knew . After this , I ’ m going to renounce my bid for presidency and give my support for you. ” Taylor ’ s heart picks up in excitement . “ Okay then , what should I tell the awaiting public ? ” She asks . “ Tell them that I , Kanye West , am a gay fish. ”","`` Two yesterday . Decided they wanted a piece of my garden . How about you , Kenneth ? '' I looked up from my notepad , my attention yanked suddenly to the conversation at hand . `` I uh ... What ? '' `` How many have you killed this week ? '' I shrugged , feeling a distinct rush from the lie I was about to tell . `` Not sure . Five or six , I suppose . '' The three others stared at me . `` Six ? Really ? '' I nodded . `` Well , or five . I said five too . I do n't really remember . '' Ferd hopped off the hood of the car he 'd been sitting on . `` Uh huh . And that 's why you 've gotten all red , I 'm sure . How old are you , Kenneth ? '' I sighed . `` Nearly twelve . Why 's it matter ? '' `` Ha ! By twelve I 'd had at least a dozen kills under my belt . Sister was the first . '' Chip shouted proudly . He was sixteen , the oldest in our group . `` So what ? '' I retorted indignantly . `` Not like I 've never killed a zombie before . '' The others blinked at me . `` Oh my god , '' Chelsea muttered . `` You 've never killed a zombie have you ? '' I shook my head , feeling the inevitable blush rising in my face . My signature tell and not a thing I could do about it . Still , I persisted . `` Sure I have ! I love killing zombies . I love ... smushing their heads in , you know . Like big bags of.. sand . '' I made a squishing motion with my hands , driving home my point . Chip nearly doubled over laughing . `` Bags of sand ! ? Are you serious ? '' Ferd walked to the overhang where I 'd been taking shelter from the heat . `` What are you drawing there , Ken ? '' `` I , uh.. - Hey ! '' Before I had a chance to react he 'd grabbed the book from me and climbed the nearest bus , waving it above his head . `` OOohh , look at this ! Some sort of shitty little sword ! How cute ! Hey Chip , you think we can start using swords to kill zombies now ? '' The others began laughing too and I felt a burning sensation start to sting my eyes . I knew the feeling ; I was about to cry . So I ran . I turned tail , leaving my precious pen and notepad . They 'd been my two dearest friends for as long as I could remember and I left them without a second thought . The worst part is that I left them to avoid *more* embarrassment . As if there would ever be a way to redeem myself . I sprinted past the rows of cars , following the highway as far as it would take me . Before long my sprint became a jog and my jog became a saunter . By the time the sun had begun setting I was strolling lazily along . Some part of me wanted Chip , Ferd and Chelsea to chase after me but they 'd probably moved on already . Kids joined and left on a daily basis , some voluntarily and others , well ... . My stomach growled . A sign listed the nearest town : Alamosa , 12 miles . And that 's when I saw her . A little girl , missing one arm , trying to open the door of a car . It looked like she wanted nothing more than to get inside , but could n't quite muster the movements required to clutch the handle . I looked at her , then behind me to ensure no one had chased after me . After I was satisfied , I approached her . Slowly at first was the rule with these things . Make a sudden movement and they would lunge at you . But as I walked up to her , I realized why she wanted so badly to enter the car . *Her pet . * She turned to look at me , her dead eyes scanning me before turning back to the door . I reached forward , edging my hand around her left side so that she would have to turn in order to grab me . I felt the handle and tugged it lightly . Gravity did the rest and the door swung open . I retreated as slowly as I 'd approached , watching the girl 's motions . She made her way inside , oblivious to my presence and curled up next to a dog 's rotting carcass . Finally content , her eyes closed and she appeared to sleep . I knew that was it for her . She shivered in her final moments , the same way my parents had after lying down next to me . My kill count remained at zero because after all this time I could n't bring myself to harm the otherwise peaceful creatures . I knew I could tell the others about this , tell them I 'd murdered a zombie in cold blood . But that would n't change the truth and it would n't change them . I had yet to meet someone who understood the dead the way I did . That was alright , though . I was only twelve then . I had plenty of time to search . > /r/mspaintshoops",5,5

I can assure you that you will be very justly rewarded for this. ” Kanye folds his fingers on top of each other and stares in Taylor ’ s direction . “ Why would you stay low at a time like this. ” “ Let ’ s just say Mr. Trump is onto something huge that I have a personal stake in . Now , do we have a deal or not ? ” Taylor laughs and begins to stand up from her seat before Kanye grabs her hand and holds her in place . “ I can help make them pay . All of those guys who left you without a second glance in your direction won ’ t have the last word . After all , everyone assumes that Guantanamo shut down , and who ’ s to say that is or is not true . Paper work gets lost all the time and sometimes try as we might stuff happens by accident. ” Kanye smiles at the last bit . Taylor looks over at Kanye and sits back down . Perhaps she could listen , if only for just a second . “ Taylor , I need you to get the word out. ” Kanye half whispers . Taylor frowns in confusion . “ This is weird , I ’ m going to turn the lights on , ” she says . Before Kanye can stop her , Taylor flips the light switch on . She stifles a scream as she realizes that she is surrounded by hundreds if not thousands of fish bowls with fish floating in them . Right in front of her , Kanye is dressed in an aqua metallic wet suit . “ What ’ s going on ? ” She manages to get out . Kanye smiles and outstretches his hands . “ Don ’ t you understand Swift ; this recent discovery has helped me come to terms with who I am . It ’ s time that everyone knew . After this , I ’ m going to renounce my bid for presidency and give my support for you. ” Taylor ’ s heart picks up in excitement . “ Okay then , what should I tell the awaiting public ? ” She asks . “ Tell them that I , Kanye West , am a gay fish. ”","`` Two yesterday . Decided they wanted a piece of my garden . How about you , Kenneth ? '' I looked up from my notepad , my attention yanked suddenly to the conversation at hand . `` I uh ... What ? '' `` How many have you killed this week ? '' I shrugged , feeling a distinct rush from the lie I was about to tell . `` Not sure . Five or six , I suppose . '' The three others stared at me . `` Six ? Really ? '' I nodded . `` Well , or five . I said five too . I do n't really remember . '' Ferd hopped off the hood of the car he 'd been sitting on . `` Uh huh . And that 's why you 've gotten all red , I 'm sure . How old are you , Kenneth ? '' I sighed . `` Nearly twelve . Why 's it matter ? '' `` Ha ! By twelve I 'd had at least a dozen kills under my belt . Sister was the first . '' Chip shouted proudly . He was sixteen , the oldest in our group . `` So what ? '' I retorted indignantly . `` Not like I 've never killed a zombie before . '' The others blinked at me . `` Oh my god , '' Chelsea muttered . `` You 've never killed a zombie have you ? '' I shook my head , feeling the inevitable blush rising in my face . My signature tell and not a thing I could do about it . Still , I persisted . `` Sure I have ! I love killing zombies . I love ... smushing their heads in , you know . Like big bags of.. sand . '' I made a squishing motion with my hands , driving home my point . Chip nearly doubled over laughing . `` Bags of sand ! ? Are you serious ? '' Ferd walked to the overhang where I 'd been taking shelter from the heat . `` What are you drawing there , Ken ? '' `` I , uh.. - Hey ! '' Before I had a chance to react he 'd grabbed the book from me and climbed the nearest bus , waving it above his head . `` OOohh , look at this ! Some sort of shitty little sword ! How cute ! Hey Chip , you think we can start using swords to kill zombies now ? '' The others began laughing too and I felt a burning sensation start to sting my eyes . I knew the feeling ; I was about to cry . So I ran . I turned tail , leaving my precious pen and notepad . They 'd been my two dearest friends for as long as I could remember and I left them without a second thought . The worst part is that I left them to avoid *more* embarrassment . As if there would ever be a way to redeem myself . I sprinted past the rows of cars , following the highway as far as it would take me . Before long my sprint became a jog and my jog became a saunter . By the time the sun had begun setting I was strolling lazily along . Some part of me wanted Chip , Ferd and Chelsea to chase after me but they 'd probably moved on already . Kids joined and left on a daily basis , some voluntarily and others , well ... . My stomach growled . A sign listed the nearest town : Alamosa , 12 miles . And that 's when I saw her . A little girl , missing one arm , trying to open the door of a car . It looked like she wanted nothing more than to get inside , but could n't quite muster the movements required to clutch the handle . I looked at her , then behind me to ensure no one had chased after me . After I was satisfied , I approached her . Slowly at first was the rule with these things . Make a sudden movement and they would lunge at you . But as I walked up to her , I realized why she wanted so badly to enter the car . *Her pet . * She turned to look at me , her dead eyes scanning me before turning back to the door . I reached forward , edging my hand around her left side so that she would have to turn in order to grab me . I felt the handle and tugged it lightly . Gravity did the rest and the door swung open . I retreated as slowly as I 'd approached , watching the girl 's motions . She made her way inside , oblivious to my presence and curled up next to a dog 's rotting carcass . Finally content , her eyes closed and she appeared to sleep . I knew that was it for her . She shivered in her final moments , the same way my parents had after lying down next to me . My kill count remained at zero because after all this time I could n't bring myself to harm the otherwise peaceful creatures . I knew I could tell the others about this , tell them I 'd murdered a zombie in cold blood . But that would n't change the truth and it would n't change them . I had yet to meet someone who understood the dead the way I did . That was alright , though . I was only twelve then . I had plenty of time to search . > /r/mspaintshoops",4,5
AMT_OV,"Taylor rushed past the hordes of reporters that lined the pathways of the spacious university campus . She dashed in and out between the teams of reporters preparing to go live in a matter of minutes , without causing a second glance in her direction . It felt like a lifetime since the news had been made public , when in reality , the leak had gone live two hours ago . No one quite knew of what to make of the news . How could anyone react to realization that we had never been the only ones in the universe ? To make matters even more puzzling , the fish like sentient creature had been discovered right in our solar system- right on Jupiter ’ s own Europa . Before Taylor even had time to make any sense of the news , she had received a call from her boss to rush directly to the “ stage ” as he liked to call his prep room for the presidential debates . When Taylor finally pushed her way to the locked classroom door , she knocked twice and entered the dark room to find her boss hunched over a nightlight and a humidifier . “ Taylor have you heard ? ” He asked without looking up from the light . She nodded . “ I have . Now what ? ” The year was 2020 and the presidential election was being hyped up more than ever before . Nobody in a thousand years could have ever predicted the outcome of the 2016 election . With only ten days to go before the general election , Hillary Clinton , after being fed up with Trump ’ s sexist remarks , challenged Trump to a bake-off . If Trump could bake a better devil ’ s food cake , then she would renounce her bid for the presidency . Much to everyone ’ s surprise , the guy could bake some of the best cake anyone could ever have . However , to no one ’ s surprise , when Donald Trump entered the presidency , he shrugged off his idea to build a giant wall and focused his attention of expanding the space program . Drawing money from his own personal fortune , Donald Trump turned the United States space program into the best in the world . When asked why he cared so much about space exploration , typical Trump would respond that he wanted to have another option in case those damn Muslim terrorist blew up the Earth . Everyone had always assumed that Trump would run for reelection , but he insisted that he didn ’ t intend to stay in office for more than four years . Now , if people thought that Trump running for president was crazy that was nothing to what the 2020 presidential candidates were . Sure some were extremely well qualified , but others , let ’ s just say no one ever considered would be running . Among those was rapper Kanye West , who ran with the Democrat party . Somehow , he rose to the top of the polls , and before anyone could say are we really doing this again , another entertainer became a contender for the white house . Nobody for the life of them could figure out how they got Kanye West vs Sarah Palin 2020 . Taylor snapped the compact mirror shut and tossed it into her tote before looking at the man sitting across from her on the private jet as they flew straight towards the Hollywood Hills . He was dressed in an immaculate black tux , a new look for him . She stayed quiet as she waited for the man to speak . After all , he had called her and she wasn ’ t one to speak unless spoken to . After a brief moment of silence , the rapper cleared his throat and tapped his hand on the table . “ Taylor , I understand that we haven ’ t been on speaking terms of as lately , but I need your help. ” Taylor stayed silent and feigned disinterest as she turned her head to look at the dozens of aquariums scattered throughout the plane . “ As you ’ ve probably heard , I ’ m running for president in 2020 and I ’ ve got a serious problem . I ’ ve done a fair bit of polls and research on my end and it appears I might have this election in the bag . I need you to make sure it stays that way. ” Taylor laughs and shakes her head . “ What do you need me for . You can hire the very best campaign manager money can buy . I don ’ t have any political experience and quite frankly I could care less about this type of stuff. ” “ That ’ s true , but you are the very best at keeping people ’ s attention . I want you to make sure that the public continues to pay attention as I lay low for a while . And perhaps maybe even stir up some dirt on Palin while you ’ re at it .

'' Ferd hopped off the hood of the car he 'd been sitting on . `` Uh huh . And that 's why you 've gotten all red , I 'm sure . How old are you , Kenneth ? '' I sighed . `` Nearly twelve . Why 's it matter ? '' `` Ha ! By twelve I 'd had at least a dozen kills under my belt . Sister was the first . '' Chip shouted proudly . He was sixteen , the oldest in our group . `` So what ? '' I retorted indignantly . `` Not like I 've never killed a zombie before . '' The others blinked at me . `` Oh my god , '' Chelsea muttered . `` You 've never killed a zombie have you ? '' I shook my head , feeling the inevitable blush rising in my face . My signature tell and not a thing I could do about it . Still , I persisted . `` Sure I have ! I love killing zombies . I love ... smushing their heads in , you know . Like big bags of.. sand . '' I made a squishing motion with my hands , driving home my point . Chip nearly doubled over laughing . `` Bags of sand ! ? Are you serious ? '' Ferd walked to the overhang where I 'd been taking shelter from the heat . `` What are you drawing there , Ken ? '' `` I , uh.. - Hey ! '' Before I had a chance to react he 'd grabbed the book from me and climbed the nearest bus , waving it above his head . `` OOohh , look at this ! Some sort of shitty little sword ! How cute ! Hey Chip , you think we can start using swords to kill zombies now ? '' The others began laughing too and I felt a burning sensation start to sting my eyes . I knew the feeling ; I was about to cry . So I ran . I turned tail , leaving my precious pen and notepad . They 'd been my two dearest friends for as long as I could remember and I left them without a second thought . The worst part is that I left them to avoid *more* embarrassment . As if there would ever be a way to redeem myself . I sprinted past the rows of cars , following the highway as far as it would take me . Before long my sprint became a jog and my jog became a saunter . By the time the sun had begun setting I was strolling lazily along . Some part of me wanted Chip , Ferd and Chelsea to chase after me but they 'd probably moved on already . Kids joined and left on a daily basis , some voluntarily and others , well ... . My stomach growled . A sign listed the nearest town : Alamosa , 12 miles . And that 's when I saw her . A little girl , missing one arm , trying to open the door of a car . It looked like she wanted nothing more than to get inside , but could n't quite muster the movements required to clutch the handle . I looked at her , then behind me to ensure no one had chased after me . After I was satisfied , I approached her . Slowly at first was the rule with these things . Make a sudden movement and they would lunge at you . But as I walked up to her , I realized why she wanted so badly to enter the car . *Her pet . * She turned to look at me , her dead eyes scanning me before turning back to the door . I reached forward , edging my hand around her left side so that she would have to turn in order to grab me . I felt the handle and tugged it lightly . Gravity did the rest and the door swung open . I retreated as slowly as I 'd approached , watching the girl 's motions . She made her way inside , oblivious to my presence and curled up next to a dog 's rotting carcass . Finally content , her eyes closed and she appeared to sleep . I knew that was it for her . She shivered in her final moments , the same way my parents had after lying down next to me . My kill count remained at zero because after all this time I could n't bring myself to harm the otherwise peaceful creatures . I knew I could tell the others about this , tell them I 'd murdered a zombie in cold blood . But that would n't change the truth and it would n't change them . I had yet to meet someone who understood the dead the way I did . That was alright , though . I was only twelve then . I had plenty of time to search . > /r/mspaintshoops",5,5

AMT_K1,"The shadows grew taller until they reached into my room , and the light of the world faded around me . I sat motionless in the dark , and a sorrowful breath escaped my lips . I fucked up again . I thought she would be different . Sure , I might have came across as a bit shy , but who does n't ? I caught her smiles so many times I could n't even count , each one unique like a snowflake . She sent me winks , compliments and wishes - which I tried my best and more to try and fulfill them . But I was wrong . Maybe I had read it wrong , or maybe she did n't know me - either way , I was once again banished to the realm of the forsaken friendzone , with nothing but a cold emptiness emanating from my heart . The thunder flashed outside , startling me slightly . 'Terrific . ' I thought . It seemed that even the weather was bringing me down . There was another flash , but this time , I did not hear the thunder . Instead , I heard whispers that entered my ears like some slimy snake , leaving an unpleasant feeling in my mind . My teeth clenched as I realized I had heard this before , but I could not remember when . What was it ? Was it during the 14th birthday ? Was it during last Christmas ? What was it ? As if to answer my question , something black and dusty exploded in front of me , causing me to be blown back into my bed . The figure materialized steadily , and I could make out image through the silhouette . It was a woman , wearing a dark pointed hat , with hair black as a street cat 's , with a robe that unified the colors . She blinked , her blue , hollow eyes glowing in the dark , and then shifted her gaze on me . I had barely enough time to recover myself when she stormed in front of me and grabbed me by the shirt . `` You ! '' She shrieked . An explosion of black smoke hissed out of her mouth as she spoke . `` W-what ? '' I stammered . I raised my hands in a surrendering gesture , but it had little effect . `` We had a deal ! '' `` Who are you ? '' I asked . She was then silent - but only for a split second . To my surprise , she released me , and clicked her fingers . In an instant , a piece of paper materialized in front of her . `` Four years ago . December the fifth . At the party . '' She stated . I carefully took the paper from her slim , bony hands , and looked over it cautiously . I was surprised to find that I could read the letters quite accurately , despite being in the dark . My face changed to confusion when I realized what the paper had said . I was to promise her me firstborn , in exchange for musical talent . Trying my best not to offend her , even taking into consideration that she may be offended by the way I looked at her , I extended the paper back to her . She snatched it without a word . `` I do n't understand . '' I said in my best feeble voice . `` You promised me your firstborn ! '' She shrieked again . The room was getting darker each time her mouth was open . `` I did ! '' I protested . `` It 's not my fault I ca n't get any girls ! '' I clenched my teeth at my protest , as I had put in more passion to the tone without realizing it . To my surprise however , the witch was taken back . `` Wait what ? '' She asked . I sighed , and showed her computer . `` Look . '' I pointed . The witch peered at the screen with narrowed eyes , and began scrolling through my chat log . I did not bother reading it again , and instead found entertainment in her reactions . Her face changed from a dreamy smile , to a raised eyebrow , to an approving look , to a grimace . She then looked at me , and scratched her head . `` In five years , she 's the only one you 've been talking to ? I mean , there has to be others right ? '' She asked . I sighed again , but added a shrug . `` But ... Why ? '' She asked me . I opened my mouth to speak - my intended answer was to be something melancholy and gentlemanly , but I closed my mouth . I felt a strange anger bubble out from inside me , and I felt the cork pulverize into dust as the fiery emotions exploded out into verbal form . `` I do n't fucking know ! '' I shouted . The witch was more taken back then before , and this time it was her turn to collapse on my bed . `` I mean , I 'm not even that bad looking right ? '' I looked at her with eyes of anger , rather than of desperation . The witch gulped and nodded . Her eyes then caught the bottle of liquor next to my monitor . `` I mean , I 'm a nice guy , I do n't treat woman badly - hell I do n't even insult them ! '' I carried on . I felt my face turn red , but I refused to believe it was the alcohol . `` But what happens ? Nothing ! Absolutely goddamn nothing ! I asked twenty three girls out - after getting to know them , know their favorite colors , their hobbies , their favorite movies , their favorite music - hell , I even found a girl that likes Heavy Metal like me , and what happens ? Nothing !

I sighed , and showed her computer . `` Look . '' I pointed . The witch peered at the screen with narrowed eyes , and began scrolling through my chat log . I did not bother reading it again , and instead found entertainment in her reactions . Her face changed from a dreamy smile , to a raised eyebrow , to an approving look , to a grimace . She then looked at me , and scratched her head . `` In five years , she 's the only one you 've been talking to ? I mean , there has to be others right ? '' She asked . I sighed again , but added a shrug . `` But ... Why ? '' She asked me . I opened my mouth to speak - my intended answer was to be something melancholy and gentlemanly , but I closed my mouth . I felt a strange anger bubble out from inside me , and I felt the cork pulverize into dust as the fiery emotions exploded out into verbal form . `` I do n't fucking know ! '' I shouted . The witch was more taken back then before , and this time it was her turn to collapse on my bed . `` I mean , I 'm not even that bad looking right ? '' I looked at her with eyes of anger , rather than of desperation . The witch gulped and nodded . Her eyes then caught the bottle of liquor next to my monitor . `` I mean , I 'm a nice guy , I do n't treat woman badly - hell I do n't even insult them ! '' I carried on . I felt my face turn red , but I refused to believe it was the alcohol . `` But what happens ? Nothing ! Absolutely goddamn nothing ! I asked twenty three girls out - after getting to know them , know their favorite colors , their hobbies , their favorite movies , their favorite music - hell , I even found a girl that likes Heavy Metal like me , and what happens ? Nothing ! '' The witch nervously stood up and began muttering something under her breath . `` I even skipped going out to my friend 's birthday party to hang with this other chick by the way , and she just told me that she wanted to be friends . It 's always with the friendship ! She 's got a million friends on facebook for crying out loud ! '' The witch began fading into black smoke , but it was slow . She began muttering faster , while looking at me and nodding with a static look . `` Hell , if she wanted friends she should be a goddamn Carebear ! I 've wasted so much of my time doing this - I do n't even know if - `` I never finished my rant , as I was interrupted by another loud explosion of smoke , to which I was knocked back from my chair . I thumped my head hard on the desk and I cursed , grasping at the back to ease the pain . I looked up to see the witch , but she was gone . I sighed for the third time , and rose to my feet . The light flickered , and were illuminated again , lighting the darkness of my room . And with a weak stumble , I collapsed into the chair and stared back at the monitor . And once again , I surrendered my eyes to the internet world , and my mind switched off as warriors , gangsters , cats , girls and cartoons flashed past me , easing the pain of my defeat .","`` I 'm sorry , '' he said . `` I know . '' I shook my head . `` No , I 've always been sorry . I 'll get through this . '' `` I 'd like to know what happened . '' He looked at me , and I could see his eyes were a deep green , like a lake . `` You 're not supposed to . '' His voice was quiet , and he looked down . `` Do n't you remember ? '' I nodded . `` Of course I do . '' We sat on the bench , and the sun was just beginning to set . The sky was a bright blue , and in the distance , a blue sky , and a blue moon . The trees were a bright green , and we could see the sky . `` Please , '' I said . He turned his head , and looked at the stars . `` There 's nothing I can do . I ca n't do anything . '' My voice was weak , and it was almost as if I was crying . `` People do n't understand . '' The tears started to fall . `` It 's not your fault . You 've done everything you could . You should have been there to help . '' he looked up , and his eyes met mine . `` But you were n't . '' There was a moment of silence , and then , `` I thought you would n't be here . '' It was n't really a question , but I felt like I was . `` How could you not be here ? '' His eyes were still wet . `` What 's wrong ? '' `` You did n't say . '' And then he leaned down , and kissed me . `` And I do n' t know why . I did n ' t know if I could do anything to help you . I just wanted to be there for you . '' Then he turned , and walked away . It was a long walk , and when he returned , he was gone . I knew it was n't his fault . I could n't help but think of how I could have helped him . I should have stayed . He 'd never have been able to help me . I would have helped myself . I had been there for him . The sun was setting , and there was a blue glow in the sky , but there was nothing I could help him . `` Why did you have to do this ? '' He asked . `` Because I could . '' But I could tell he was n 't . I was n'/I did n'T . I never wanted to help him , but when he was so close , and so close to me , I could feel him . He would n' be there . He was n bedrooms . He had n't been ableTo help me , but he was there . I fell asleep . The next day , I was at work , and my phone rang . `` Is that you ? '' It could n 'T be . `` Yes , '' it said . I looked at it . `` Where are you ? `` I do it all the time . ''",5,0
AMT_4Y,"The storm flung towering pillars of sand against the walls of the cabin , rattling the windows in their flimsy frames and sending waves of dust through the gap beneath the door . We crouched in the far corner , hunkered down between the beds , and watched a barrage of leaves and debris plaster themselves against the glass . No one spoke . We sat in spiritual silence , Pa 's jaw grinding slowly back and forth on itself the way it did in church when the priest took too long with the homily . Ma held my sister , rocking her back and forth . I could tell it was as much to soothe Ma 's fears as Jenny 's . The wind had a voice . It screamed at us to flee , to seek more substantial cover , but we had nowhere else to go . Three years ago , I 'd seen my first tornado , a black funnel the size of a city that fell out of the swirling sky in the east . Lightning cracked the air around it . I 'd never been able to shake the feeling that it was only a matter of time before the funnel returned and swallowed me up . A blast of wind hit the cabin from the side and clattered the pots and pans that hung along the wall . Startled by the noise , I glanced in that direction and saw a dark shape flash past the window . Suddenly it was very cold in the cabin . I clutched my knees to my chest , staring out the window , trying to glimpse something -- anything -- to help me attach a rational explanation to the shape . It was no use . The billowing dust obscured everything more than a foot from the windows . We might as well have been the last people on a plague-ravaged Earth , sitting out the final storm . I became aware of a sound along the wall behind me . Straining to hear it over the howling wind , I pressed an ear against the wood . *Tap tap . Tap tap TAP TAP TAP* My heart slammed a breakneck rhythm . I tugged Pa 's sleeve and leaned to shout in his ear : `` I think there 's something out there !

My hand groped around for support before it grabbed onto the kitchen counter . `` Please be careful .

The tools I had at the time were a dinner knife and a fork . `` P-please . '' She started crying . The ghost started crying . If she could hold onto something , she probably would 've held onto me . Like she usually did . `` I love you . I love you so much . So please , move on . '' Huh . 'So please ' is what she said to me that day . Her last words . I could feel the tears running down my cheeks . `` So please , live for me . '' Yeah . I remember everything . She was the only patient to die under my scalpel . Her diagnosis was 27 stab wounds to the chest , abdomen , and throat . The time was 13:00 . Three years ago , I saw her bigot father run through the church and mutilate her . He was n't even invited . 'If she was n't his baby girl then no one can have her . ' I tried to save her , but all I had were the wedding utensils and a couple of gaping wounds . My phone rang . It was one of the nurses . `` Doctor , there 's an emergency patient . There 's no doctors on-site -- '' `` Sorry nurse . I 'm drunk . ''",5,5

With the curtains closed our worlds become almost the same . At any rate , the light is just as warm to me as it is to her . If I close my eyes , we can be one .

Not just with the flourishes of her hands as she signs to me how pretty the new tune I 've written is , but also in the soft touch of her fingers on my skin , her light breath on my face , and the worlds she creates on canvas . She tells me I am beautiful in a way I can never know . And somehow it means more when she says it . She 's not the only one who does ; so many others have called me a genius , an inspiration . A deaf pianist , what a miracle ! I do n't think it 's a miracle . If it was , I would n't know . I see the keys , I play them , they say it makes them feel something beautiful but it means nothing to me . All I know is what she tells me .

All I know is that she hears me , and she loves what she hears . Maybe it 's the same as why I love her . She touches me in a way that she can not understand . She creates beautiful worlds that I try to describe to her , but my words are never enough . She 'll never know what her creations make me feel , but maybe that is what makes them so wonderful . It 's hard to hold back tears when I stop to think about it . She is my inspiration . She lets me know what I make her feel by making me feel the same way . She is a miracle , and the words 'blind painter ' do n't even begin to describe why . She lights this word with a light she can not see , gives it a meaning she can not understand , she exists to create a paradise open to everyone but herself . And so I finally understand . This is what I am to her , this is what I make her feel . We may not be able to know the beauty in ourselves , but we can know the beauty of each other . She is the meaning in my life , and I am the meaning in hers . I do n't know how , but I can feel these words rush through me and into the notes I am playing .

Face knows what their in for and sighs heavily , moving their hands up to cover their eyes before lightly dragging their fingers down their face , stopping only to rest their chin on the very tips of their fingers . “ … can you ? ” “ oh… of course … . just a moment… ' God fumbles around in his smock until he finds the dial and manages to turn his aura and voice amplification down , not off , mind . “ Sorry , Face … I know you hate that. ” Eager smile like a dog at breakfast while Face is nodding off again , the flow of the sea calling him under . “ Face , please ! I got ta know , man ! What 's it like ? ” “ ..ugh ” half turn of the head and an outward stretch of the arms , Face is awake now , though dry-eyed . “ ca n't you just ... just go and look for yourself ? ” God sheepishly toes the pebbles . “ Well ...

You know , the one with the rollercoaster where it looks like your gon na plunge into lava , you get really close to the lava and you 're going crazy fast but you do n't actually go in the lava , you just miss it. ” God 's incredulous eyebrows raised beyond possibility , Face 's unequally distributed ; a cocked eyebrow the Rock 'd be proud of . “ So.. ” Face 's interest piqued “ let me get this straight . You went to ride The Lavanator , 'the hottest ride cloudside ' … . Instead… I mean… instead of finding out what all that rubbish down there , all that , I do n't even know what the hell that is , down on earth ? ... You went to six flags instead of finding that out ? …. ” “ You should see their burgers , man . I- ” “ I ca n't believe- ” “ It 's not like I have n't been there before , I invented it remember ? Built it with my own bare hands ! This cloud here , that pearly gate there . Was way quicker than earth too , only four days for heaven , a lot easier when you 're working with a more basic colour scheme . I just want to know what you thought of it , you know ? Constructive feedback. ” “ OK , OK fine . I 'll tell you how it was. ” Wily now , cogs turning at the optimum rate . “ I was a little surprised by the flowery garland I received on entrance but though 'hey , loosen up , nothing to stress about now I 'm dead . ' The sofas were incredibly comfortable and those cool little drinks holders , you know , the ones that mould to the shape of your glass , they 're a revelation ! I can tell you that right now . The food was pretty good , especially the shrimp platter which was like a religious experience , honestly , I needed a moment alone with that one. ” “ Ha , yeah . I think I had that one a few years ago , delicious… go on ... ” “ I ate that for what felt like four straight years since there are no full stomachs in heaven , no hunger either , it 's fantastic . Plus they only serve virtuous shrimp , so it 's ethically sound . After that it was time for the real business , what everyone is really here to do . The lights dim down and the music switches from choirboy hymns to some smoky improv harp . At this point winged centaurs carry especially luscious clouds topped with the most incredibly beautiful women and men into the great hall , naked as you intended them to be and beaming like the sun itself . Cherubs bring forward the massage tables and it beautifully scented oils fall lightly from above as we all take our places. ” Face is sure he could wave a hand in front of God 's eyes and he would n't even notice , so far into his imagination has he receded . “ ... but you know all of this , right ? You invented it all after all. ” ..uhh.. yeah , yeah . I know . The oil clouds were a stroke of genius , heh… let 's just say 'you 're welcome . ' “ I KNEW IT ! ” “ Umm ... knew what , Face ? ” “ You 've never even been , have you ? ! You did n't build it at all ! ” “ THEY WO N'T LET ME IN ! ” Almost in tears . “ I 've tried ! So many times but they 've got some kind of 'no deity ' rule . Apparently it 's not healthy for you humans to worship anything and they do n't want me peddling my business in there… say it will upset the equilibrium. ” “ Uh huh … I know. ” Sympathetic tones now . “ it 's just , you know , with the whole 'no time ' thing they 've got going on , they do n't really need you. ” “ … m-m-maybe you could help me , you 've been there , you could help me get in.. ” “ ..it 's just ... and I know you 're not gon na want to hear this , buddy , but I 'm just not sure you 'll ever be let in… ” “ ... but why ? ... what 's it like ? ” “ well , you see … . let me start this off simply… in heaven there is no money . At no point can you have more or less money than your fellow person . In heaven there is no property . At no point can you have a bigger or smaller house than your fellow person . In heaven , the words 'she , ' 'he , ' 'his ' 'hers ' have been abolished . There are no gender divisions , only people . In heaven there is no good or evil , no gay or straight , no class system , only people . Nationalities are as laughable as races are absurd . There are only people , hanging out , working hard for one another , letting people be what they want , when they want . There 's a lot more fruit and veg too which is a highlight , all free , of course . I 'll swap my yam for you carrots , you know… . Anyway… sorry … what I 'm trying to say is , you go in there and start throwing your weight around , trying to get everyone to look up and bow down , you will mess up the equilibrium . People believe in each other in there , they do n't need someone to fear or someone to impress or someone to keep them in check you know ... ” “ Oh … I see . ”",5,3

AMT_KG,"Warm rays of sunlight peek through the crack between the curtains and touch softly on my skin . She tells me they make no sound , and I 'm glad . With the curtains closed our worlds become almost the same . At any rate , the light is just as warm to me as it is to her . If I close my eyes , we can be one . I can see the keys before me , can see the soft twisting of light they reflect as I play them , but they are silent to me . I only know the music they make is beautiful because she tells me so . My world is bright and colourful , but it is quiet . She is the only one who speaks to me . Not just with the flourishes of her hands as she signs to me how pretty the new tune I 've written is , but also in the soft touch of her fingers on my skin , her light breath on my face , and the worlds she creates on canvas . She tells me I am beautiful in a way I can never know . And somehow it means more when she says it . She 's not the only one who does ; so many others have called me a genius , an inspiration . A deaf pianist , what a miracle ! I do n't think it 's a miracle . If it was , I would n't know . I see the keys , I play them , they say it makes them feel something beautiful but it means nothing to me . All I know is what she tells me . And I struggle to speak back because speaking is hard for me , and I do n't know what she hears when I do . What I say is probably different from what I mean , and I ca n't know if it is or not .

All I know is that she hears me , and she loves what she hears . Maybe it 's the same as why I love her . She touches me in a way that she can not understand . She creates beautiful worlds that I try to describe to her , but my words are never enough . She 'll never know what her creations make me feel , but maybe that is what makes them so wonderful . It 's hard to hold back tears when I stop to think about it . She is my inspiration . She lets me know what I make her feel by making me feel the same way . She is a miracle , and the words 'blind painter ' do n't even begin to describe why . She lights this word with a light she can not see , gives it a meaning she can not understand , she exists to create a paradise open to everyone but herself . And so I finally understand . This is what I am to her , this is what I make her feel . We may not be able to know the beauty in ourselves , but we can know the beauty of each other . She is the meaning in my life , and I am the meaning in hers . I do n't know how , but I can feel these words rush through me and into the notes I am playing .

AMT_T5,"When Sergeant Mathers shouted through the headset aboard the plane before the jump , the words he spoke cut me like a hot knife through butter . `` Within 2 hours you will either kill or be killed . When you hit the ground , they will be shooting at you . Shoot them first . '' My parents did n't amount to much , but they were fantastic parents . I am their only child so when I got drafted , their initial response was to pack my bags and send me off to my cousin in South Africa . Before the war I had n't been hit by the patriotism bug that many had , but when I saw a picture of the Prom King that I went to school with head 's cut in two by the blade of a downed MiG , I knew I could not pass off the call when it came . As I stood at the now open door of the plane , it was this memory that took my mind off Mather 's comment long enough to forget about vomiting . I glanced down at the grey Stars and Stripes patch on my uniform and leapt from the plane . The first few moments after the jump were a blur . Even now I do n't remember any of it . I 'd zoned out until a crack snapped past my head . The fuckers were firing anti-aircraft rounds at us . Cheap shot . At least it was pitch black , but they got damn close considering they were firing blind . `` Contact '' shouted Mathers . It was way too late to change course and I pulled my chute . The sound of a parachute opening is always a relief . At least when you are n't being shot at from the ground . I could hear the chutes of my comrades launch . The radio crackled . `` Is everyone OK ? '' Mathers asked in an unusually nervous tone . I do n't think even he had experienced anything like that before . We took the term sitting ducks to a new level that night . `` Jones , Graham , Thompson , Baker ... '' . The register was entirely met with ayes . The firing from the ground stopped . We landed 2 clicks East of our intended destination but after looking at the team , I do n't think any of them cared . They looked drawn out . Zombie-like almost . I had never felt more alive . My heart was pumping but it felt good . It was euphoric . Tough-nut Mathers had already composed himself and pinpointed on his map where we had to go . The Spanish air smelled sweet . We were set to rendezvous in the rebel held City of Valencia . The Russian/German alliance had been decimated by a series of allied nuclear attacks in France , Poland and and Southern Russia . The UK Prime Minister ordered the attacks after intelligence advised of a planned German invasion from France . History always seems to repeat itself . 17 million had died as a result of the allied bombs . When it happened I could n't believe it , but not I felt as though I could take the rebels on by hand . I was ready to fight . I was ready to die . I did n't enjoy school , and from what I 've already said you can gather that I was n't Prom King . Not even close in fact . I was quite literally last in line to the throne . Probably behind a few of the girls too , I might add . I 'm not particularly hideous and certainly not overweight but in the social jungle of High School I chose to keep myself to myself . I 'm not sure why I was thinking about school as we trecked silently through nighttime Spain . The occasional gun shot could be heard but the Spanish rebels were hardly the most reserved characters . We were on the edge of the city when we came across a Humvee by the side of the road . It was strange purely because there were n't supposed to be any Allied forces in this area yet . As we got closer to it we found a puddle of blood behind the wheel . I brought my gun up ready to fire . I was damn ready to kill someone . I peered into the vehicle to find a headless Marine . I should have been disgusted but I was n't . I was excited . I overheard Jones muttering away while I was in the Humvee searching for anything useful . `` CONTACT RIGHT '' `` CONTACT LEFT '' What the fuck . All at once . This was it . The moment .

My excitement turned to dismay . CHRIST . Where had his face gone . Were they shooting bricks ? Damn . There was nothing left from the shoulders up . I was lucky to be covered by the vehicle . I duck down and collect my thoughts . The feeling of being alive was back . Stronger this time . I did n't want to lose it . I soon realised why Jones had no head left when anti-aircraft rounds slammed into the Humvee . Poor Jones had taken a round to the head . He died like Obama in Kingsman . Losing his head in a puff of smoke . I looked across at Mathers who had found his way into a ditch . They 'd taken out th attackers on the right while I was out cold . He pointed at the Humvee I was hiding behind . He wanted me to get on the mounted 50 cal . Okay . I climbed into the Humvee and peered out a hole in the back . The shooting stopped . Something had jammed in their gun in the back of a pick up truck . This was my moment . I jumped up , readied the weapon and fired . They noticed and tried to run but it was too late . My bullets cut them down . 10s of lives ended just like that . One of them only looked like a kid . 15 maybe , but I did n't care . `` Good job , Private . '' Barked Mathers . I went over to him .

She wore a black cloak and a black helm that was covered in a black hood , and her hair was a deep brown , and it was tied back with a black leather belt .

I glanced down at the grey Stars and Stripes patch on my uniform and leapt from the plane . The first few moments after the jump were a blur . Even now I do n't remember any of it . I 'd zoned out until a crack snapped past my head . The fuckers were firing anti-aircraft rounds at us . Cheap shot . At least it was pitch black , but they got damn close considering they were firing blind . `` Contact '' shouted Mathers . It was way too late to change course and I pulled my chute . The sound of a parachute opening is always a relief . At least when you are n't being shot at from the ground . I could hear the chutes of my comrades launch . The radio crackled . `` Is everyone OK ? '' Mathers asked in an unusually nervous tone . I do n't think even he had experienced anything like that before . We took the term sitting ducks to a new level that night . `` Jones , Graham , Thompson , Baker ... '' . The register was entirely met with ayes . The firing from the ground stopped . We landed 2 clicks East of our intended destination but after looking at the team , I do n't think any of them cared . They looked drawn out . Zombie-like almost . I had never felt more alive . My heart was pumping but it felt good . It was euphoric . Tough-nut Mathers had already composed himself and pinpointed on his map where we had to go . The Spanish air smelled sweet . We were set to rendezvous in the rebel held City of Valencia . The Russian/German alliance had been decimated by a series of allied nuclear attacks in France , Poland and and Southern Russia . The UK Prime Minister ordered the attacks after intelligence advised of a planned German invasion from France . History always seems to repeat itself . 17 million had died as a result of the allied bombs . When it happened I could n't believe it , but not I felt as though I could take the rebels on by hand . I was ready to fight . I was ready to die . I did n't enjoy school , and from what I 've already said you can gather that I was n't Prom King . Not even close in fact . I was quite literally last in line to the throne . Probably behind a few of the girls too , I might add . I 'm not particularly hideous and certainly not overweight but in the social jungle of High School I chose to keep myself to myself . I 'm not sure why I was thinking about school as we trecked silently through nighttime Spain . The occasional gun shot could be heard but the Spanish rebels were hardly the most reserved characters . We were on the edge of the city when we came across a Humvee by the side of the road . It was strange purely because there were n't supposed to be any Allied forces in this area yet . As we got closer to it we found a puddle of blood behind the wheel . I brought my gun up ready to fire . I was damn ready to kill someone . I peered into the vehicle to find a headless Marine . I should have been disgusted but I was n't . I was excited . I overheard Jones muttering away while I was in the Humvee searching for anything useful . `` CONTACT RIGHT '' `` CONTACT LEFT '' What the fuck . All at once . This was it . The moment . I scrambled to get out of the Humvee , slipped in the excitement and slammed my head into the door frame thing . As I came to I saw Jones get shot in the head . Splat . That was him done . My excitement turned to dismay . CHRIST . Where had his face gone . Were they shooting bricks ? Damn . There was nothing left from the shoulders up . I was lucky to be covered by the vehicle . I duck down and collect my thoughts . The feeling of being alive was back . Stronger this time . I did n't want to lose it . I soon realised why Jones had no head left when anti-aircraft rounds slammed into the Humvee . Poor Jones had taken a round to the head . He died like Obama in Kingsman . Losing his head in a puff of smoke . I looked across at Mathers who had found his way into a ditch . They 'd taken out th attackers on the right while I was out cold . He pointed at the Humvee I was hiding behind . He wanted me to get on the mounted 50 cal . Okay . I climbed into the Humvee and peered out a hole in the back . The shooting stopped . Something had jammed in their gun in the back of a pick up truck . This was my moment . I jumped up , readied the weapon and fired . They noticed and tried to run but it was too late . My bullets cut them down . 10s of lives ended just like that . One of them only looked like a kid . 15 maybe , but I did n't care . `` Good job , Private . '' Barked Mathers . I went over to him . He patted me on the back and I threw up . `` That 's war for you . '' He was right . That was war . And I fucking loved it .","He was n't sure if it was a woman , but she was n that much more beautiful than the other knights he 'd met . She was a beautiful woman , with dark hair and eyes that were just as blue as the sky . She had a small smile that would make you smile for days , and a laugh that would shake your world as it were . She looked like a woman who had seen the world and was a knight , and she was a warrior . She wore a black cloak and a black helm that was covered in a black hood , and her hair was a deep brown , and it was tied back with a black leather belt . She held a sword that was made of a silver blade , and the blade was made from a thin silver chain , and was held in her right hand . Her eyes were black , but they were a deep blue , and they shone like the sun . The eyes were n't as bright as the sun , but the eyes were as bright . She stood in front of him , and he could n't help but feel a sense of relief . He was n' t afraid of her . He had saved her life , and now she was here , in the middle of the night , in front in front with him , with a sword in her hand . He could n'T help but smile , as he saw the tears in her eyes , and then he saw that she was crying . He looked down at the sword in his hand , and saw a small amount of blood on it , and his heart sank . He knew what she was going to do to him . He did n't know what she would do to me , but he knew she was right . He pulled out the sword , and as he did so , he saw her eyes . She could n 't see him . She did n ' t see him , but it was clear that she could see him ! She was n 'T afraid of him . The sword was a dark green , and had a silver chain around it , but that was n Spain . She drank from the flask in her arm . She stared at the knight with her eyes and smiled . She took the sword from his hand and put it on the ground . She pulled the sword out of her hands , and looked at him . `` I 'm sorry , '' she said . `` You did n't know . '' He looked at her , and smiled back . She smiled back , and took the blade from his hands . `` It 's okay , '' he said . He put the sword on the floor , and watched it fall to the ground , and moved it to the side , and pulled it back . `` Do n't worry , '' the knight said . The knight looked up at him , then to the sky , and laughed . `` So you 're the knight that saved my life , '' said the knight , `` and you 've saved mine . ''",5,2
AMT_UX,"When the mist eyed man entered the shop and began flitting from bookshelf to bookshelf , Malcolm did n't pay him much attention . It was the end of his shift on a humid Saturday where all he could think about was the summer party happening later that night . And Tessa . Most of the bookstore 's patrons made their way out of the cramped wooden door well before closing time . All except for the mist eyed man . He had been thumbing through books in every section , then shaking his head in disappointment before moving onto another shelf . Malcolm watched him glide through the sci-fi section , onto romance and business books before finally landing in religion and staying there for a while . Malcolm eyes kept straying back to the clock that now read 5:55 pm , and then back to the man who had a stack of books ringing the creaky old wooden chair in the far corner of the shop . He sighed to himself and began re-shelving stray books while throwing glances in the corner occasionally at the quiet old man . Finally , some minutes later , the strange man rose from his place and walked over to the counter . Oddly , he had no books in hand as he shuffled his way up to the counter top . `` Excuse me . '' the man said shaking voice worn down by age and experience `` I hope I 'm not bothering you , good sir . I 'm looking for something that does n't exist . '' Malcolm gave him an incredulous stare . `` You 're uh ... I 'm sorry ? '' `` Yes , '' he beamed back at him `` It does n't exist , well not yet anyway . '' He looked back over his shoulder `` I think one of these books may be able to help me , but I 'm not sure which ? Malcolm checked the clock again . 6:01 pm . `` I 'm sorry sir , but we 're actually closed now . '' He explained `` Maybe you could come back tomorrow ? I 'm sure someone could help you as much as you need then . '' The man heaved a tremendous sigh . `` No ... no it must be today . That 's quite alright then , '' the man turned back toward the door `` perhaps within the next 100 years then . '' `` Wait ! '' Malcolm was n't sure why he was shouting , but the man stood stone still either way . `` Ah , 100 years ? What do you mean ? '' The man turned back , and shuffled his way up to the counter . Leaning forward he drew Malcolm in and whispered `` Yes , once every 100 years something that does n't exist , does . It 's only for the briefest of moments but it will revolutionize the way you see the world . '' Malcolm was intrigued . He thought about checking the clock again , after all the party started at 7 but then , he figured , how long could it take to help an old man find a book ? `` Well , I can make a bit of time I suppose . What kind of book is it ? '' `` Books . '' the old man corrected . He made his way back to the various shelves and began thumbing through the same books again . `` An author has a particular way of writing . A voice , if you will . This very special thing demands that the right voices come together in harmony . '' He pulled an old , worn fantasy book down from the shelf and thumbed through it before handing it back to Malcolm . `` Harmony ? '' he asked , while taking the book from the man 's frail hands . `` Yes , yes harmony . Everything in the world is wrought in harmony and books are no different . Ah ! Here . '' He 'd gathered a collection of books from every genre and indicated for Malcolm to lay them all out . Malcolm obeyed , laying the books side by side while opening each to a different page . `` Yes , here this one should be page 219 . And this , here should be page 15 . '' The misty eyed man pointed to the first book at the beginning of the row . `` And finally , the first page . '' `` What now ? '' Malcolm asked . His mind raced with possibility . `` Now , '' the man said with a surprisingly toothy grin `` Now we read . ''","`` How long has it been ? '' The scientist asked . `` I do n't know , I do not know , '' I answered . `` But it 's been a while , '' he said , `` It 's about a year and a half now . '' `` I know , but I 'm not sure I 've ever seen anything like this before . '' I said . `` You know what I mean , '' the scientist said , his eyes brightening . `` We have n't been able to find a catalyst . '' He looked at me , his cheeks turning red , `` You 've been working on this for a long time , and we 've never found one . '' The scientists were all silent . `` What ? '' I asked . The scientist nodded , `` I 'll tell you what . '' They all stared at me . `` It started with a single soul . It was n't a soul at first . It took a few years , but it started to become a body . It started as a single human . '' he continued . `` Then it became a soul . '' My heart began to race . `` So , '' He said , nodding . `` Now , we have found a soul that is n't human . It 'll be our first step in curing cancer . '' We all looked at each other . `` Well , what are we going to do ? '' `` We 're going to put it to the test , '' said the scientist . `` Let 's get it on the table . '' we all looked around . `` How long ? '' He asked . He looked around again . `` Like , a year ? '' We nodded . `` No , '' we said , and he turned to leave . `` Not a week . '' His eyes turned to me . He pulled out a small , white ball of paper . `` This is what we 're gon na do .

Malcolm eyes kept straying back to the clock that now read 5:55 pm , and then back to the man who had a stack of books ringing the creaky old wooden chair in the far corner of the shop . He sighed to himself and began re-shelving stray books while throwing glances in the corner occasionally at the quiet old man . Finally , some minutes later , the strange man rose from his place and walked over to the counter . Oddly , he had no books in hand as he shuffled his way up to the counter top . `` Excuse me . '' the man said shaking voice worn down by age and experience `` I hope I 'm not bothering you , good sir . I 'm looking for something that does n't exist . '' Malcolm gave him an incredulous stare . `` You 're uh ... I 'm sorry ? '' `` Yes , '' he beamed back at him `` It does n't exist , well not yet anyway . '' He looked back over his shoulder `` I think one of these books may be able to help me , but I 'm not sure which ? Malcolm checked the clock again . 6:01 pm . `` I 'm sorry sir , but we 're actually closed now . '' He explained `` Maybe you could come back tomorrow ? I 'm sure someone could help you as much as you need then . '' The man heaved a tremendous sigh . `` No ... no it must be today . That 's quite alright then , '' the man turned back toward the door `` perhaps within the next 100 years then . '' `` Wait ! '' Malcolm was n't sure why he was shouting , but the man stood stone still either way . `` Ah , 100 years ? What do you mean ? '' The man turned back , and shuffled his way up to the counter . Leaning forward he drew Malcolm in and whispered `` Yes , once every 100 years something that does n't exist , does . It 's only for the briefest of moments but it will revolutionize the way you see the world . '' Malcolm was intrigued . He thought about checking the clock again , after all the party started at 7 but then , he figured , how long could it take to help an old man find a book ? `` Well , I can make a bit of time I suppose . What kind of book is it ? '' `` Books . '' the old man corrected . He made his way back to the various shelves and began thumbing through the same books again . `` An author has a particular way of writing . A voice , if you will . This very special thing demands that the right voices come together in harmony . '' He pulled an old , worn fantasy book down from the shelf and thumbed through it before handing it back to Malcolm . `` Harmony ? '' he asked , while taking the book from the man 's frail hands . `` Yes , yes harmony . Everything in the world is wrought in harmony and books are no different . Ah ! Here . '' He 'd gathered a collection of books from every genre and indicated for Malcolm to lay them all out . Malcolm obeyed , laying the books side by side while opening each to a different page . `` Yes , here this one should be page 219 . And this , here should be page 15 . '' The misty eyed man pointed to the first book at the beginning of the row . `` And finally , the first page . '' `` What now ? '' Malcolm asked . His mind raced with possibility . `` Now , '' the man said with a surprisingly toothy grin `` Now we read . ''","`` How long has it been ? '' The scientist asked . `` I do n't know , I do not know , '' I answered . `` But it 's been a while , '' he said , `` It 's about a year and a half now . '' `` I know , but I 'm not sure I 've ever seen anything like this before . '' I said . `` You know what I mean , '' the scientist said , his eyes brightening . `` We have n't been able to find a catalyst . '' He looked at me , his cheeks turning red , `` You 've been working on this for a long time , and we 've never found one . '' The scientists were all silent . `` What ? '' I asked . The scientist nodded , `` I 'll tell you what . '' They all stared at me . `` It started with a single soul . It was n't a soul at first . It took a few years , but it started to become a body . It started as a single human . '' he continued . `` Then it became a soul . '' My heart began to race . `` So , '' He said , nodding . `` Now , we have found a soul that is n't human . It 'll be our first step in curing cancer . '' We all looked at each other . `` Well , what are we going to do ? '' `` We 're going to put it to the test , '' said the scientist . `` Let 's get it on the table . '' we all looked around . `` How long ? '' He asked . He looked around again . `` Like , a year ? '' We nodded . `` No , '' we said , and he turned to leave . `` Not a week . '' His eyes turned to me . He pulled out a small , white ball of paper . `` This is what we 're gon na do . '' It was a small piece of paper , and it was the only thing that would stop the cancer . `` Do you think it 'll work ? '' he asked . I looked at it . `` Yes , '' it said . It had a small circle on it . It said , '' It 'd work . '' This was the first time I had ever seen a soul , and I was curious . `` And what is it ? '' It asked . We all nodded . We looked at the ball . `` Is it a soul ? '' the Scientist asked . It nodded . The scientists looked at us . `` Okay , '' they said . The man turned back to the ball , `` What do you think ? '' we asked . They all looked up at me and nodded . I nodded back . `` There 's a soul in there . '' they all said . I stared at it in disbelief . `` Where is it coming from ? ''",5,2

The lady at the desk looked up and said “ Hello , my name is Rachel ! Welcome to Murphtown City Hospital ! How may I assist you ? ” as I reached the desk . Well… here goes . “ Hey . Yeah . So um . I am not really sure how to put this so I am just going to lay it down straight. ” I gained more confidence as I spoke . “ I am from the future .

Thank you. ” Before I could think of what else to say two uniformed men walked up behind me and grabbed both of my arms . I flailed my legs around frantically trying to stop the men from dragging me out of the hospital . “ NO STOP ! PLEASE ! YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME ! ” I kicked and screamed but they would n't stop . As we got closer to the exit I turned my head to see a new born child in a small bassinet bin , on a cart , being pushed into the hospital . Written on the bin was the name “ Jeremy Walter ” in large black letters . “ THERE ! OVER THERE ! THATS HIM ! LET GO OF ME ! ” A sudden pulse of strength erupted from my muscles and I managed to knock over the two security officers that were dragging me . All three of us fell to the ground . I got back up as quickly as I could and bolted toward the baby . Instinct drove me , without thinking I slammed my body hard into the nurse that was pushing the cart . I grabbed hold of the babies cart , pushing it with me as I ran down a hallway and out of sight . I could hear the commotion of the people behind me and the security guards running in after me . I turned left as the hallway turned into a T-intersection and continued running . Another left . Then a right . Then ... A dead end ! No , wait ? There ! A flight of stairs on the right ! There was no way I would be able to push the cart up the stairs so I quickly , but carefully , picked up the child in my arms and started running up the stairs two at a time . Down in the distance I could hear the guards yell `` He ran up the stairs ! '' . What was I doing ? This is a child in my arms that was no more than a few days old . This could n't be a coincidence though . I was sent to this exact time , and landed in this exact place . This had to be him . This must be what I was sent here to do . I was met at the top of the staircase with a closed metal door . I peaked over the edge of the stairwell to see four security guards running up , guns in hand . I opened the door and ran out to find myself on the roof of the hospital . This was it . There 's no where else to go . I ran over to the edge of the roof and tried to look for a way down . I heard a voice call out behind me . `` Put that child down NOW ! '' I turned around to see four guns pointing at me ready to blow my brains out . I took a step back toward the edge . `` DO N'T YOU DARE TAKE ANOTHER STEP . '' Tears were flowing down my face . I needed them to understand . `` Do n't shoot ! Please ! Ca n't you see I am trying to help you . I am trying to save all of you ! This child . Jeremy Walter . He 's the beginning of the end . But it does n't have to be that way !

When I walked into the hospital I spotted a young lady sitting behind a receptionist desk . As I made my way over I tried to think of how I could explain ... everything . I decided I would just tell her the truth . She had to believe me . She just had to . The survival of the entire human race was at stake . The lady at the desk looked up and said “ Hello , my name is Rachel ! Welcome to Murphtown City Hospital ! How may I assist you ? ” as I reached the desk . Well… here goes . “ Hey . Yeah . So um . I am not really sure how to put this so I am just going to lay it down straight. ” I gained more confidence as I spoke . “ I am from the future .

I am not playing any games this is serious ! ” Rachel stood up , “ Sir I am going to have to call security If you refuse to step aside. ” She said frowning . “ Alright , alright .

As we got closer to the exit I turned my head to see a new born child in a small bassinet bin , on a cart , being pushed into the hospital . Written on the bin was the name “ Jeremy Walter ” in large black letters . “ THERE ! OVER THERE ! THATS HIM ! LET GO OF ME ! ” A sudden pulse of strength erupted from my muscles and I managed to knock over the two security officers that were dragging me . All three of us fell to the ground . I got back up as quickly as I could and bolted toward the baby . Instinct drove me , without thinking I slammed my body hard into the nurse that was pushing the cart . I grabbed hold of the babies cart , pushing it with me as I ran down a hallway and out of sight . I could hear the commotion of the people behind me and the security guards running in after me . I turned left as the hallway turned into a T-intersection and continued running . Another left . Then a right . Then ... A dead end ! No , wait ? There ! A flight of stairs on the right ! There was no way I would be able to push the cart up the stairs so I quickly , but carefully , picked up the child in my arms and started running up the stairs two at a time . Down in the distance I could hear the guards yell `` He ran up the stairs ! '' . What was I doing ? This is a child in my arms that was no more than a few days old . This could n't be a coincidence though . I was sent to this exact time , and landed in this exact place . This had to be him . This must be what I was sent here to do . I was met at the top of the staircase with a closed metal door . I peaked over the edge of the stairwell to see four security guards running up , guns in hand . I opened the door and ran out to find myself on the roof of the hospital . This was it . There 's no where else to go . I ran over to the edge of the roof and tried to look for a way down . I heard a voice call out behind me . `` Put that child down NOW ! '' I turned around to see four guns pointing at me ready to blow my brains out . I took a step back toward the edge . `` DO N'T YOU DARE TAKE ANOTHER STEP . '' Tears were flowing down my face . I needed them to understand . `` Do n't shoot ! Please ! Ca n't you see I am trying to help you . I am trying to save all of you ! This child . Jeremy Walter . He 's the beginning of the end . But it does n't have to be that way ! '' The officers looked very confused , and then regained their composure . One of them fired a warning shot in the air . `` I 'M TRYING TO SAVE YOU ! '' I scream desperately . One of the officers put his gun back in its holster and stepped forward . `` Sir . You are not thinking straight . '' He inched closer and closer as he spoke . `` Look down in your arms . Its just a child . An innocent child . We can help you , if you will just hand me the child . '' More tears welled down my face , a lump filled my throat . `` I 'm sorry . '' I threw the child over the edge of the roof and immediately felt the impact of multiple bullets hitting my chest . I fell to my knees , smiling , knowing I had just saved the entire human race .","`` I 'm glad you are here , '' I said . `` I 've been waiting for you .

'' I asked , `` I was just wondering if I should tell you about the place I live . '' The man smiled back . `` It 's a nice place . '' With a nod , he took my hand . `` You 'll see .

I kept my eyelids shut out of fear that if I opened them , my eyeballs would be ripped out of their sockets .

All-American has taken out a good fair share of my men . I should ’ ve known better than to underestimate her . She ’ s not that impressive but there ’ s a certain resilience to her that shouldn ’ t be undermined . I often do that when it comes to her , she exudes that kind of vibe . Her costume is bloodied . As I descend a nearby staircase , I remained cloaked in shadows as I watch her attempt to take on five men at once . “ Stop ! ” I yell , pulling out a revolver . My bullet will hit right in between the eyes of All-American and I ’ m pretty sure of it . I ’ m a good shot . “ Some men you are . Can ’ t even take out Taylor Swift playing dress up , ” I smirk . My men are annoyed , but I don ’ t care . Shame is a useful weapon when it comes to teaching and I can not afford to welcome the next do-gooder with a display like this . I might not be there to deal with the next one . All-American flips towards me , I guess in some attempt to kick the gun out of my grip . I use my free hand to grab one of her legs and smack her into a nearby pillar . She cries out in agony as she hits the ground , but I grab her by the neck pressing her up to the pillar . “ Why are you doing this ? ” she asks , and a tear is actually streaming down her face . “ For a better America. ” “ You can ’ t honestly believe that , ” she says . “ You ’ re everything that America doesn ’ t stand for . Your whole manifesto is basically mind control , it ’ s taking away everything that makes a person an actual person . How can you even look yourself in the mirror and call yourself the Patriot ? ” That ’ s what I call myself : the Patriot . “ How can you do it ? We ’ re fighting for a better America , I ’ m fighting for my future . You can stop this , Patriot . They say you used to be good , that you used to be one of us . If you really were , you ’ d stop this now . You ’ d stop. ” She ’ s right when she says I used to be one of them . She doesn ’ t know how right she is . I press my gun to her temple . “ This is the only way America can have a future . This is the only way America can be a place of peace , a good place for the future . People like you , with your wild ideas of freedom and creativity will always be a threat to the norms of society . People like you will always be what ’ s wrong with America . People like you bring change that can not be regulated . What the world needs now is order – not your brand of do-gooder chaos. ” ’ I used to share the same dream she did . I used to think that by fighting for freedom , I was doing America a favor . I used to be just as All-American as she says she is . I used to be just like her until a group of people cornered the love of my life on a lonely road on a winter night and took a slugger to his skull . I used to think that fighting for America meant something – until I saw that there will always be differences that create chaos . So I will forge a better America with my own hands . I pull the trigger and rip off her mask . And the dream she has , the dream she thinks is worth something dies with her . And as she dies , I look into her eyes and I recognize her green eyes , her blonde hair . A face I ’ ve seen a thousand times . Hayley Morris , my late fiancé ’ s younger sister . Once a promising MIT student , now a crime fighter . I don ’ t remove my mask . I don ’ t let her know who I am . I used to be All-American . I used to feel All-American . Now I feel like no one .","`` I 'm going to have to go . '' I said to the man I had been watching for the last few hours . He was a tall , dark man , and he was wearing a dark suit with a dark tie . He had a look of tiredness in his eyes . I knew he had been through a lot , and that was the reason he was still alive . `` You 're going to go , '' I told him . `` I 'll take you with me . '' He looked at me with a look that told me he was scared . `` No , I 've been waiting for you . '' `` No . I 'd like to go with you . I do n't want to be alone . '' The man looked at us , and then at me again . He gave me a look as if to say , `` I do not want to go alone . I want you to go out with me , '' he said . `` But you have to , '' the man said , and I looked at him with a smile on my face . `` It 's my turn . '' he replied . `` That 's it , '' a voice said . I looked up , and there was a man standing there . `` Yes , '' said the man , with a grin on his face . He smiled at me , and said , `` It was a good decision . '' We both looked at each other , and the man who had been looking at us and smiled said , '' It was the best decision I 's ever made . '' And then I took a step back , and looked at the man . He looked back at me . `` What are you going to do , '' asked the man in the suit . `` Go with me ? '' I asked , and we walked out the door . `` Do n't you want to take me with you ? '' he asked . `` Just go with me ! '' I yelled . `` And you will get your revenge ! '' he shouted , and with that , he ran away . I walked down the street , and out of the building , and into the woods . I took my time , and waited for the man to come back . I did n't have to wait long . I saw him , and when he came back , I could hear him crying . `` Why did you do that ? '' `` I could n't , '' was all I could say . `` The war is over , '' my voice was weak , and my voice cracked . `` There is no more war . '' It took a long time for me to get back to the house , and for the men to leave . I sat in the dark , and listened to the gunshot . I could feel my heart beating . I felt the blood on my hands , and it was cold , and hard . I heard the screams of the men as they ran by . I wanted to stop them . I was going to stop the war . I would n't let it end like this . I had to stop it . I turned around , and saw the man that had been staring at me stand up . He said , with his eyes full of fear , `` You are going to get your vengeance . '' and then he ran . I watched him run , and watched as he ran from the house . I stood there , and wondered what I would do . I reached the house and looked around . The house was empty , and no one was there . I left the house to go to the woods , and began to walk home . I ran , and ran , but I could not find the man at the door that I was looking for . I kept running , and running , but no one came . I continued on , and finally I reached my home . As I walked home , I saw the door , and in the house was a woman . She was a girl , and she was crying . I stopped and looked her in the eyes . `` Are you okay ? '' she asked . I asked her , `` Are we going to be okay ? I do . '' She looked at my face , and tears started to well up in her eyes . She said , I do , and so I ran . The man with the suit walked out of my house , with me following .",5,0

I turned , sprinting hard towards it and running in . The Arcanine sniffed at the entrance , but walked away . I breathed out a sigh of relief , opening my bag and pulling out a bottle of water . I sipped from it , when I heard a noise from somewhere in the cave . I froze , and looked around . In the corner was a small , shivering figure . I pulled a small , worn dagger out of my bag . It was blunt and rusted , but if I was in danger ... As I approached the figure , it lifted it 's head . It was a young trainer . He inched back into the corner , sobbing . `` Do n't hurt me ... . '' He squeaked . I put the dagger back in my bag , and knelt down next to the kid . He looked up at me . `` Hey , kid ... where are your parents ? '' I asked . He stood up , walking to the entrance of the cave . He pointed to a town burning far in the background . Oh . He turned to me . I noticed that his shoes were barely held together , and his clothes were torn and dirty . He looked at my bag . `` M-may I have some food , if you have any ? '' He asked , averting his eyes . I pulled a strip of beef jerky out of my bag , along with a water bottle . I handed them to him , and he ate the food quickly , drinking water in between bites . He smiled , thanking me . Then we heard a screech from further into the cave , and a Zubat came flying out at us . Without thinking I grabbed the kid , running out of the cave . The Zubat did n't follow , but the screeches attracted a large Charizard , who swung at us . I ran , and ran as far as I could , but I tripped , falling hard onto the ground near a pond .

Its floor a peeling green on concrete with fake wood trim covering the walls . They sit on high stools and stare at each other while a large cup sits on the table . Behind them , classical music plays through an ipad . An alarm on the ipad goes off , showing the alarm notification for 4am . Tommy reaches over to silence it , but leaves the Blue Danube Waltz to play on . Jenny looks around the room at everyone as she reaches for the cup . Its lukewarm kool-aid sloshing as she lifts it to her mouth . She tastes it a little and hesitates . One big gulp later , she gives a big smile now- stained red with the drink , looks at everyone in the room , and carefully puts it down . A moment later her eyes close and she falls off her chair . Sarah reaches over , feels for a pulse , and makes a knife-across-the-throat motion to Tommy and Lenny . Sarah pets Jenny 's cheek for a moment and uses the tips of her index finger to close Jenny 's blank and staring-into-space eyes . Tommy snaps up quickly knocking his chair over , opens his mouth about to say something , but quickly snaps his mouth shut , his teeth making a snapping noise , and screams right before taking a big gulp . He stands , bewildered for a moment , and falls over . Sarah is biting her fist and refuses to look at his body . Lenny just stares off into space but his eyes dart to Tommy 's still body for a moment . Tommy is sprawled into an exaggerated motion , his arms and legs sticking out in an almost comedic fashion . He twitches a little and then stops . Sarah does n't bother to check his body . She nods at Lenny and her eyes begin to tear up . Lenny puts his finger to her lips and makes a knowing look . He kisses her forehead . Lenny reaches for the cup , but Sarah stops him . They half-heartedly wrestle for the cup but Lenny gives up to Sarah as she silently mouths `` please . '' He looks down at the grain and scratches on the surface of the table for a moment . Sarah stares at the cup in her hands for a good 30 seconds . Lenny watches as she drinks it , knocking her head back in a big gulp , like how children swallow pills . His fingers tap on the wooden table louder and louder . Sarah makes one drowsy motion with her hand , trying to communicate something , but she falls over before finishing . Lenny stops tapping his fingers and stares at her body for a minute . Lenny sits for a moment staring at the cup , then the wood grain , then running his fingers over the grain then briefly touching the cup . He looks at his three dead friends , stands , and knocks the cup on the floor , spilling the poison kool-aid onto the lime green concrete floor . He looks at the red spill in a sea of green , pauses , and spits on it . He then carefully arranges the bodies in a neat row while fixing their clothes and hair as much as possible as tears run down his face . He holds each persons hand just for a few seconds each . He feels the back of their hands with his thumb , rubbing hard over the cooling skin , over and over . Finally he makes them all hold hands and face each other . He then picks up the prepared letter with all their signatures- including his own , examines the signatures for a moment , crumples it , and puts it in his front pocket . He gets into his car and drives to the police station as the radio blares some pop song , walks up to the the first person he sees , and hands the police officer the crumpled note .

He twitches a little and then stops . Sarah does n't bother to check his body . She nods at Lenny and her eyes begin to tear up . Lenny puts his finger to her lips and makes a knowing look . He kisses her forehead . Lenny reaches for the cup , but Sarah stops him . They half-heartedly wrestle for the cup but Lenny gives up to Sarah as she silently mouths `` please .

Lenny watches as she drinks it , knocking her head back in a big gulp , like how children swallow pills . His fingers tap on the wooden table louder and louder . Sarah makes one drowsy motion with her hand , trying to communicate something , but she falls over before finishing . Lenny stops tapping his fingers and stares at her body for a minute .

He then picks up the prepared letter with all their signatures- including his own , examines the signatures for a moment , crumples it , and puts it in his front pocket .

I turned , sprinting hard towards it and running in . The Arcanine sniffed at the entrance , but walked away . I breathed out a sigh of relief , opening my bag and pulling out a bottle of water . I sipped from it , when I heard a noise from somewhere in the cave . I froze , and looked around . In the corner was a small , shivering figure . I pulled a small , worn dagger out of my bag . It was blunt and rusted , but if I was in danger ... As I approached the figure , it lifted it 's head . It was a young trainer . He inched back into the corner , sobbing . `` Do n't hurt me ... .

I pulled a strip of beef jerky out of my bag , along with a water bottle . I handed them to him , and he ate the food quickly , drinking water in between bites . He smiled , thanking me . Then we heard a screech from further into the cave , and a Zubat came flying out at us . Without thinking I grabbed the kid , running out of the cave . The Zubat did n't follow , but the screeches attracted a large Charizard , who swung at us . I ran , and ran as far as I could , but I tripped , falling hard onto the ground near a pond .

He turned , climbing onto a high ledge on the cliff near us . The Charizard roared , striking me with his arm . I fell backwards into the water , attempting to catch onto a vine ...

At least our solar system was actually 8 planets now , much like Frieza 's soon would be . RKM : Relativistic Kill Missile","`` Another drink ? '' I asked , reaching toward the liquor cabinet . Luckily for us it was well stocked . `` Do I ever say no ? '' Eugene laughed , finishing off the one he had in his hand . It 'd been 3 weeks since we got snowed in this place , but it actually was n't bad . Neither Eugene nor myself had any real love for our countries . Sent out to die because some asshole I did n't even vote for ca n't keep his mouth shut . Sure , the first couple nights were tense , but since then we 've treated it as a vacation . Storytelling by the fire , and a lot of booze . I filled the glasses and hobbled on over to him . `` Walking a bit better ? '' Eugene thanked me , grabbed the glass , and took a nice sized drink . `` Yeah , Caroline 's a miracle work ... '' Shit , I 'm an idiot . Luckily for me Eugene just laughed . `` It 's fine , my foot could n't be saved . Besides , it means once we get out of here I get to go home , they 'll probably toss your ass back on the front lines . '' He took another big drink . `` You know it 's funny . We 're a different race , we have different religions , and we come from a world apart , but none of that seems to matter . when we sit down and share a drink . '' I sat next to Eugene . `` Damn right . Do n't care what you look like , who you pray to , or who you follow as long as you can make a good drink ! '' His glass is almost empty now , man this guy can drink . `` Men can be weird like that . Gods ca n't get in the way of a friendship , but a pretty girl can . '' Eugene gave me puzzled look as I slid the knife into his side . `` I know she chose you , but I want her . '' Tears welled up in Eugene 's eyes , but he did n't make a sound as he slumped over . Eugene was a great guy , but not as great as having 2 months alone with Caroline . She 'd learn to love me by then .",4,5

AMT_2M,"I was sitting in the living room , watching the news , and it was the most boring thing I 'd ever seen . The news was about a new technology that had been released to the public . It was called `` The Brain . '' It was a new method of learning . It would allow you to learn new skills in the old fashioned way . It had been invented to be a more efficient way to learn all the skills of the future . The idea was that the brain would be a much more efficient tool for learning , and the brain could be used for a lot of things . They would be able to learn more , and better . People would be more productive , and they would be well-paid . But it would be impossible to teach the brain to learn the skills . It 's all about the mind . You had to learn how to think , and learn how not to think . I was sitting there , watching , when I heard a voice . It sounded like a man . He was a man , but he was n't speaking English . He looked like he was in his late 20s , and he was wearing a suit and tie . He had a beard , and a beard was a bit too long . He wore a suit , and was wearing some sort of sunglasses , but I did n't really know what they were . He said , `` You can learn the new skill of the mind , and you can learn it from me . '' I looked up . He smiled , and said , '' You 're in my office . '' He was n Prairie-dog , a dog . I did not know what that meant . I looked at him , and I did have a dog , but it was n Tinder . I had to ask him , `` What do you know about the new skills ? '' He smiled again , `` Well , I 'm a dog and I 've been learning them . '' `` What ? '' I asked . `` I 'll show you . '' The man looked at me , and looked at the screen . `` You 've got to be kidding me . I 's a dog ! '' I nodded . `` But I 're not . '' he said , and then he started to laugh . `` Remember , you 're a dog now . You 'll be able TO learn the skill of a dog in the new way . '' And I did . I could n't believe what I was hearing . I wanted to know more . I asked him , '' What is the newskill of the brain ? '' `` It 'll teach you how to eat . ''","The world was a beautiful place . I had never been one to lie , but I knew what it was like to be in a world where people were happy . I was a happy person , and I was never one to be sad . I lived a happy life . I did n't care about the way I looked . I never cared about the fact that I was good at my job , or that I had a nice house , or even that I would be able to afford the house . I just wanted to be happy . It was the only thing that kept me going . I loved my job . I liked the way my life was . I felt like I was happy . But then one day , I was in a meeting . I do n't know why I was there , but it was a meeting of a group of people . I knew I was supposed to be there . I could n't help but be nervous . I mean , I 'd been working with this group of men for years , but they were n't the most interesting people . They were n'yone I 've ever met . They all had the same interests , the same friends , and the same hobbies . I 'm not sure why I thought I could be so different . I guess I was n't . I think I was jealous of them . I wanted to feel like they were different . They had a different life , a different family , and a different friends . I saw them as people . But I was just a normal guy , a normal man . I thought they were the same . I went to the meeting , and it was just like any other meeting . The same people , the exact same people . The only difference was that I felt different . It 's not that I saw a different world . I actually felt like a different person . I looked around the room . I expected to see the same people I had been with for years .

AMT_1U,"`` Yeah I know you can read minds , '' the voice scowled . *What ? * I thought . `` Sitting there cocky and all . Thoughts are meant to be private , you know ? That 's why they 're called *thoughts* , '' the voice enunciated the last word . It was a feminine voice for sure . The park was crowded . Much too crowded to identify the one girl talking back . Thinking back ? I lowered my noise-cancelling headphones and listened for anyone actually talking to me . Nothing . Just kids laughing and parents yelling after them . I re-raised the headphones back into place . The headphones were n't necessary for me to read minds , but it allowed me to distinguish them easier . No external noise penetrated them . It gave me tight control of my ability . I gave a final visual scan of my surroundings . No one stuck out . Hmm , interesting . Ever since I was little I thought I was unique . I knew I was unique in reading minds , absolutely . From finding out where my parents hid my presents to getting answers from professors I was always a step ahead of the curve . Most of the time thoughts were so boring , though . Everybody was the same . Insecurities , ideas of what to eat , and money - I 'd heard it all - hundreds of times over . Just across the pasture a cute girl gazed in my direction . She smiled . *Ooh* . I had to see what that meant . I 'turned ' on my ability . `` Oh my god . He 's so cute ! Those headphones are too big for his head - what a dork . But SO cute ... Now he 's looking at me . What do I do ? '' *She 's really into me , * I thought . I smiled at her . She smiled back . I gathered my things and made my way over to her . `` Here he comes . He 's actually coming over to talk to me ! '' *Wow ! I am nailing this . * `` How 's my hair look ? '' She adjusted her hair nervously . *I love when girls do that . * `` Oh my gosh . He smiled again . So cocky ! I loved that . '' I had approached her . She was sitting .

I re-raised the headphones back into place . The headphones were n't necessary for me to read minds , but it allowed me to distinguish them easier . No external noise penetrated them . It gave me tight control of my ability . I gave a final visual scan of my surroundings . No one stuck out . Hmm , interesting . Ever since I was little I thought I was unique . I knew I was unique in reading minds , absolutely . From finding out where my parents hid my presents to getting answers from professors I was always a step ahead of the curve .

'' `` It was a story . '' But he did nukes me . His face went blank . `` A story about a bad life . '' That was the second lies . `` That was n't a lie ? ! '' I screamed . `` How could you tell me that ? '' I yelled . He looked at me , and said . '' You 'd think I was crazy . '' A tear rolled down his face , and his eyes went wide . `` Your story is a lie ! '' He shouted . `` Do n't lie . It 'll be a lie if you tell it . '' We both stood there for a moment , and the tears started to fall . `` Then what ? '' The old man asked . `` Why ? '' It seemed like he was in a trance . `` Because I 'M A BAD PERSON . ''",5,0
AMT_CV,"`` I do n't know what to do . '' I said to myself . I had been waiting for this moment for years , and I had n't even been able to get on the train . I 'd been waiting a long time to get off the train , and now I was going to get my chance . I stood up from the train bench and started to walk to the door . I could n't believe it , I had to get out . I walked over to the platform , and the woman in front of me was about to give birth . I was n't sure what to think . I knew that I could get on . I did n't want to be on the subway , but I was too scared to be a part of this . I looked at the woman . She was beautiful , with long blonde hair and blue eyes , and a face that had been so beautiful . She had this look of pure wealth , and she was about as beautiful as I had ever seen .

I needed to be there , but at this point I was getting anxious . I ran my hand through my hair , and it was a little wet . I leaned back in my seat and tried not to think about it . I heard a loud bang , and as I looked up , I saw a bright light . I turned to see the woman standing there . She looked like she was wearing a black dress , with a pink dress shirt and a blue dress pants , and was holding a baby in her arms . She smiled at me . She started to cry . I watched her as she threw her arms around me and cried . I saw her crying so hard I felt like I was crying too . She pulled me to my feet , and started crying . She held me close , and we cried together . I closed my eyes , but she kept crying . I realized that I had no idea what to say , and that I needed a new direction . I found myself crying again . I opened my eyes and I saw the woman crying , and her face was full of tears . I let my head fall back , I could see that I was still crying . Then I felt the tears coming from my eyes . I reached out to hold her , but the tears were n't coming from me . I held her tight and I looked down . She cried a little more , and said , `` I 'm sorry .

It couldn ’ t hurt to try and *not* pass out , just to see what happened . Right ? So I did it . I sat on my bed and forced myself to keep my eyes open , fighting the urge that tried to drag me down to sleep . I was barely an hour into my attempt , when there came a knock at my front door . I opened it to find a woman staring at me . Her eyes creeped me out : a grey so transparent they seemed almost silver . “ I thought so . Why aren ’ t you asleep ? ” she demanded . “ Uhm ... what ? Who are you ? Why are you at my house ? ” I asked . She gave a soft snort . “ Not this , again. ” She reached up and softly touched my forehead .

AMT_E3,"Harold wrapped the cloak of blackness around him like a familiar coat . He could feel the rope tighten like a firm hand around his throat . He had not lived a good or happy life . His mother Margaret had just been the product of a sad cycle , he couldn ’ t blame her without also blaming himself . She hadn ’ t chosen to be the victim of child abuse or the domino effect it would have on the rest of her life . Maybe she could have overcome it , been stronger and not passed that abuse down another generation , but maybe she couldn ’ t have . Harold knew what he was , always would be . He could feel his mother ’ s weakness inside him . He had never considered himself very brave , very strong or very smart . In his optimistic moments he thought it was just the abuse talking , but Harold had always been more of a pessimist . He knew he was just like her , he was so full of hate and anger , with a temper that was as violent as it was unpredictable . There was only one real way to break the cycle . School had been a place of misery , he couldn ’ t help but get into fights . He did n't fit in , and was always on the outside , his rage would leak out on the few unfortunate children who had taken the bullying too far . Suspension and expulsion , had become a revolving door of punishment , but had done nothing to help Harold . Each one only leading to a new and more brutal beating at home . The blows would come from the darkness , her foot steps silent on the thick carpet , the pain always coming from a new direction . She had been blind long enough to know exactly how to make sight an undefeatable advantage . So all he could do was wait for it to end , and then clean up the mess . It didn ’ t get easier as he got older , as others his age started to see . His highschool had advanced sight courses , you ’ d learned how important it was to see at an early age . They ’ d quote statistics that strongly correlated “ age at sight development ” with all sorts of positive life developments , they didn ’ t mention the statistics for the late bloomers , but the worst was always implied . And of course the first thing you ’ d hear from a kid once they could see was the long list of things blind people had never done . There had never been a blind , president or Senator . None of the famous sport stars were blind , and none of truly famous and loved Actors had ever been blind . There had of course been a few successful scientist that has made it through the various blind purges in history , and others that had made their mark , but there had always been an unspoken ugliness that followed these people , a scar on their legacy unfaded by the generations . As more kids transitioned into the world of the sighted , Harold could feel himself gradually transitioning from the majority into the minority . Life would never get to be easy for him . In highschool he was at least one of many , in college he was one of few . As an adult being blind was something to stay away from , a sign of human malfunction . Nobody ever asked if it had been a choice , a fear that kept him blind , everyone just assumed it wasn ’ t . Looking back now , the feeling disappearing from his limbs as the blood makes one final push to protect his vital organs , a gentle coldness creeping in from the darkness , he ca n't help but feel a sharp twist of regret as he remembered the one girl who he had given sight to .","The world is a cruel place . The government has taken control of our lives and it is now the responsibility of the majority of us to make sure that no one ever gets the chance to do anything wrong . The people of this world have been under the rule of the government for centuries . They have been given the power to decide what they want to do with their lives . They are now the most powerful people on the planet . They can do anything they want , they can do whatever they want . They do n't need to be rich or powerful , they are just the most intelligent . But they can be the most destructive . They could destroy the very foundation of the world . They were the first to do so . They stole the first few billion dollars from their parents . They took their parents ' savings and used it to buy a house . They used their parents to buy themselves a car , a house , a dog , and a house of their own . They then used their money to buy everything else . They ran the world and they were the most evil people on earth . They did n't have to worry about being the smartest or the most beautiful or the smartest . They just had to be the smartest and the most dangerous . They would use their money and they would use it to do whatever the government wanted . The world was a cruel and destructive place . They had no choice but to destroy themselves . They destroyed themselves . But that was n't the only reason why they were so powerful . They also destroyed themselves by destroying their children . They killed their children and they killed their grandchildren . They even killed their great grandchildren . It was a sad and sad world . We were the last people to die . We could n't stop them . They came back and they took everything they wanted from us . They condemned us to a life of misery . They slaughtered us . We had to die to survive . We did noult the best we could , we had to fight back . We fought back and we won . We won . But we did nforces of nature , our ancestors , and we took the world by storm . We took everything we could . The first to die were the ones who had the most money . We gave them the money . They gave us the most power . The last to die was the one who was the most important . They made the most of their money . The second to die , they took their children 's money . So they killed them . The third to die did nt have to die at all . They brought them back to life . They turned them into the most successful people in the world , the most wealthy people in history . They created the greatest weapons of war . They built weapons that could destroy all the world 's weapons . They smashed the world with the power of their hearts . They called them `` bullets '' . They shared their power with the world as they did the world in war . The war was fought for the sake of the people . They fought for their lives , they fought for what they wanted . They attacked the world for their power . They wanted to take everything they had . They tried to destroy the world to get what they had , and they did naught . They won . And they were n't alone .",5,1

You heard me saying a prayer for ... someone I really could care for ... * The man with glasses and a hole in his head walked into the Tops casino and scanned the room . No sign of Benny yet . The tables were full of gamblers , diners and drinkers in various sates of mind . Sober , drunk , poor , rich , winners , losers .

He was conspicuously unarmed , like all the patrons , but the man 's expert eyes could make out the outline of a laser pistol hidden under his suit , mirroring his own 9mm in a hidden pocket of his duster . More importantly , the vault-suited man had a Pip-boy , like his own . Now that 's something you do n't see that often in the wastes . Deciding he 'd try and learn more , the spectacled man waved the waitress over for a whisky and went to stand at the bar next to the vault-suited patron . Seeing his new drinking buddy , Vault-Man turned to him with a genuine smile . `` Howdy , pardner '' , he said . `` I think that 's what you 're supposed to say in these parts . At least , that 's what that one-wheeled cowboy robot said ... '' `` Victor ? You 've met Victor ? `` Of course .

'' *I could n't feel any better , or I 'd be saaaaaaaaad* That was a question he 'd heard before . The answer was clear . `` The grave . You ? '' `` I could say the same . A bigger grave than yours I 'm sure , but a grave nonetheless . Who are you , then , to cheat death like it ai n't nothing ? '' `` I am ... was ... am a courier with the Mojave Express , nothing more . '' `` Ah , a Courier . I 've met another one of you on my way west . He was somethin ' .

You come from the east then ? You with the Legion ? '' *Why do n't you do right , like some other men do ? * `` Nah , I 'm not with them . I come from farther out east , where the Legion would actually be considered progress . I did cross their territory on my way here though . '' `` You crossed Legion territory ? Alone ? '' `` Man , I come from a place where bombs from the Great War still litter the ground . The only human beings you see are either coked-out assholes like them Fiends you got there , or are destined to be enslaved , raped or eaten , not necessarily in that order . The only other people you have are nutjob power-armored zealots fighting endless armies of Super Mutants like those that have your NCR shitting themselves in the hills . I made my way through all that to get out of there . Trust me , a bunch of jumped-up tribals like the Legion were n't gon na stop me . '' The Courier was n't about to dispute that . The fire in Vault Man 's eyes was proof enough that he could , and did , do exactly what he said . It was a fire the Courier knew all too well , the kind that could drive a man to gut a Deathclaw with a rusty Ripper if it came to that . `` Anyway '' , continued Vault Man , `` what brings you out here , friend ? '' `` Unfinished business . '' `` Ah , if I had a cap everytime I heard that one ... Last guy who had unfinished business to settle was a man set on fire and thrown in a canyon .

Strange detail I remember , though , he had an Old World flag on his duster ... That ring a bell ? '' `` No . '' Something had made the Courier 's skin crawl though . `` Your way west ? You come from the east then ? You with the Legion ? '' *Why do n't you do right , like some other men do ? * `` Nah , I 'm not with them . I come from farther out east , where the Legion would actually be considered progress . I did cross their territory on my way here though . '' `` You crossed Legion territory ? Alone ? '' `` Man , I come from a place where bombs from the Great War still litter the ground . The only human beings you see are either coked-out assholes like them Fiends you got there , or are destined to be enslaved , raped or eaten , not necessarily in that order . The only other people you have are nutjob power-armored zealots fighting endless armies of Super Mutants like those that have your NCR shitting themselves in the hills . I made my way through all that to get out of there . Trust me , a bunch of jumped-up tribals like the Legion were n't gon na stop me . '' The Courier was n't about to dispute that . The fire in Vault Man 's eyes was proof enough that he could , and did , do exactly what he said . It was a fire the Courier knew all too well , the kind that could drive a man to gut a Deathclaw with a rusty Ripper if it came to that . `` Anyway '' , continued Vault Man , `` what brings you out here , friend ? '' `` Unfinished business . '' `` Ah , if I had a cap everytime I heard that one ... Last guy who had unfinished business to settle was a man set on fire and thrown in a canyon . You do n't have anything like that , do you ? '' `` Not so bad . But a guy did shoot me in the head , some time ago . That 's what I 'm here for . He owns this place . '' *In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red ... Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead ... * `` What ? Your mark runs with the Chairmen ? Man , you must really want him , to run into their den like it 's nothing ... '' `` Not like it 's nothing . I do n't have a plan , I 'm making it all up as I go along . Last time I did that ... Well , last time I did that , I negotiated a hostage situation with some Great Khans , but I 'm dealing with bigger fish now . '' At that moment , the elevator doors opened and Benny walked in . The Courier had almost drawn his gun and started shooting , when he realised Benny was n't alone . Four armed guards trailed him close , SMGs at the ready . How like the chief of the Chairmen to stack the odds in his favor . The Courier turned towards Vault-Man . `` Hey , listen , you look like you can handle yourself . Wan na tag along with me for a while ? I can use the extra firepower , and there 's a bunch of caps and an introduction to Mr. House in it for you '' `` Hah , keep your caps , I 've got more money than I can spend anyway . I 've got nothing better to do though , and you look like a guy who gets in trouble often . I like trouble . And meeting Mr. House is a pretty good deal sweetener . '' `` Great . My guy just walked into the room . Let 's go . '' With hands on their guns , both men walked casually towards Benny and his goons . *Like the fellow once said , ai n't that a kick in the heaaaaaaaaaaaad ! ! *","I 'm a soldier . I 'm the last of my family . I have n't seen my wife in months and I have no idea what I 've done to deserve this . I am a soldier , and I am going to die . I was a soldier in the military , I 'd been a soldier for years , and now I 'll be a soldier on the battlefield . I do n't know what I was doing before I was drafted , but I 's not sure I 'M going to be able to do it again . I hope I 're not the last one . I wish I could go back . I know I have to . I can not . I need to go back , and also I need my wife . I miss her so much . I want to be with her , and she needs me . I love her so very much . My wife is the only person I have left . She is my only reason . I will never see her again . And I have nothing left to give . I could n't do it . I ca n't take her with me . It 's too late . I must go . I wo n't see her . I look forward to seeing her again , but that 's all I can think of . I feel like I 'res going to lose her . They are going to take her . The last thing I want is to see her , but it 's been a long time . I never thought I would see her one more time . They told me she was dead . She was n't . She died in the war . She 's gone . I did n't have the chance to see the war , but the war is over . I still have my wife , and so does she . I thank God for that . I just wish I had more time to see my wife again . She will be gone soon . I might never see my daughter again . It was n's time for me to go . My last day . I had to leave . I knew I would n't be able reclaim her . All I could do was watch her go . She would be gone . The only thing I could see was her face . I should have seen her when she was alive . I would have been proud of her . We were going to have a nice life . She had a great life . I wanted to be there for her . But I did . I missed her . She did n’ t want to go either . I ’ m sorry . I loved her .",5,1
AMT_U0,"It was a short knock on the door . I heard it , and I could n't help but feel a little bit of fear . I opened the door and looked inside . I was n't sure what I expected . I had been expecting a man with a beard . A man who looked like he was in his forties . I could see the wrinkles on his face and the wrinkles in his hair . He looked like a man who had been through a lot . I did n't know if he had a wife or kids . He was nae a man of many years , but he had seemed to have a bit of a troubled past . I took a step back and tried to figure out what I was expecting . `` Hello ? '' I asked . `` I 'm sorry ? '' He said . I 'd heard that voice before , but I did not expect it to be a man . `` What do you want ? '' `` I want to talk to you . '' He looked so familiar . I knew he was the man I had heard about . `` You 're my friend . '' I said . `` How can I help you ? '' The man looked at me with a smile . `` Well , I 've been looking for you for a while . '' `` Well ... I 'll tell you . It 's just that I 'M not sure what you 're asking . '' The voice was soft and soft . I just wanted to know what he was talking about . I felt a little nervous . I looked around the room . I found my way to the closet door . `` Do n't go in there . '' he said . He seemed to be in a hurry . `` Please . '' '' I whispered . He opened the closet . `` But I 's not going in there , '' he replied . `` Why not ? '' he asked . I said , `` Because I 'VE been looking . I do n't want to see you . I want you to be happy . '' His eyes were filled with tears . I tried to keep my composure . I wanted to tell him that I would n't let him see the pain in my eyes . `` Look , I do not want to hurt you . You 've done nothing wrong . I know you have n't been able to , but you 've not been able . You do n sandbox me , you know . I can not let you hurt me . '' It was a little too late .

While the floor area didn ’ t live up to the hype inspired by our guide , this was more than made up for in height – thin ledges lining the walls were spaced out seemingly eternally above us , each providing access to eight doors . The floor was made of terrazzo , with a simple rectangular platform embedded in the center of the room . I guessed this was for the guide ’ s use in navigating the archives . Against the wall were eight bare platforms aligned with the upper level ’ s doors . One for each of us . Our guide stood in the center and spoke . He was tall and wore a mask and a black robe . The man was rather unremarkable , like the rest of this place ( excluding the eternally high ceiling ) , but he somehow demanded more attention than anyone I had ever met . His dialect was painfully enunciated but his speech was plain , and like everything else he said up to this point , it was repeated in Spanish and two other languages for the four of us who didn ’ t speak English . As instructed , we all moved to stand by our platforms . I was on the side of the entry opposite the side the guide started on . I would be last , but I didn ’ t wait long – the guide spent the next thirty or so minutes giving individual attention to my peers , bequeathing them various items and quietly discussing… whatever .

AMT_KV,"The clock ticked . The Creators had left . Probability and the Creators ' sciences suggested that other beings , like the Creators would one day come . The clock ticked . It was a good robot . That was the last words of the Creators : `` You 're a good robot , robot . It 's a shame we can not take you with us . But be a good companion robot and stay here . '' It had pondered those words for millenia , as the dust , and the spiders built up , its servos and mechanisms struggling to retain functionality . The clock ticked . Perhaps it should seek Creator-like beings , move and search ? But it was told to stay . The clock ticked . It heard movement , but supposed it was a rat , like many others . The Creators took many species , samples of populations , but left many indigenous species to the world they left behind . Rats , bats , insects , birds , and many more creatures were left to go wild . Perhaps they could one day become Creator-like ? The clock ticked . It hummed a tune , 'Love me Tender ' from its databanks . The sudden sound disturbed a spider and caused it to abandon its web in fright . Many years later , the spider 's descendants returned to the original spot and began a new web . The clock ticked . It heard the sound of rocks crumbling . It pondered this , but supposed geological decay was inevitable given time and exposure to the elements without maintainence . The clock ticked . It played a short glam rock song , and bobbed its head lightly . It wondered when it would hear a new musical source . Perhaps the spiders were playing a tune all along it could n't comprehend , from the twanging of their webs ? The clock ticked . The crumbling was louder . Clear sounds could be heard , as bricks and mortar were chiselled aside . Words , of an unknown language , echoed through the chamber . The clock ticked . Eventually , light pierced the chamber , glowing , and purple . Creators ? The clock ticked . They were Creator-like . Especially the one with the Sharp-LONGSWORD-damascus*unknowncomposition* # errorimpossiblefeatureerror # , although it was a little bit taller than the statistical norm for the Creators .

They wanted to make an example out of him , they put him out in the field and lined up to shoot him . I was one of the firing line . George tried to stop me but I believed my superiors . While our officer watched the time , Edward just kept staring at me . I held my gun and stared back . He kept clutching a piece of paper , this letter , and holding it to his chest .

Elliott ] ( http : //www.soldierstudies.org/index.php ? action=soldier_profile & Soldier=89 ) were real people who volunteered to serve in the Connecticut military during the Civil War . George mustered out as an Artificer in 1864 . James continued on to reenlist until the end of the Civil War . Edward is believed to have deserted and fled to Canada .

Obi-Wan is the main protagonist of the films . It starts with Obi-Wan completing his training alone with Yoda , they could be discussing their worries about the future of the Jedi . Then it focusses on Obi-Wan becoming a teaching figure and finding Anakin , who could be a street-rat sort of character , misbehaving but insanely talented . In the context of panic about the future of the Jedi , Obi-Wan wants to train Anakin . Obi-Wan also finds and trains some other promising Jedi , including a female character who becomes romantically involved with Anakin , and later gives birth to Luke and Leia . Obi-Wan should be only slightly older than Anakin . The films focus on their characters and their relationship from the start and actually establish their friendship . Cue epic force and lightsaber training scenes with some Yoda in the mix , fun adventures together etc ... From there you can simultaneously establish Palpatine 's character as another older Jedi , frustrated with the current obedience and ethics of the Jedi , who remain faithful to their respective realms . He believes that due to their power and skill , the Jedi should group together and rise up to rule . Palpatine has met Obi-Wan and Yoda a couple of times , and he meets Anakin once while visiting them . While doing his own work , he somehow stumbles upon an ancient Sith manuscript or force sensitive object , and teaches himself the ways of the dark side , becoming very powerful . Palpatine tries to convince other Jedi to join his cause , and he kills any of the Jedi who do n't accept . The Jedi are too morally sound and passive to join him , and they do not have a lust for power being satisfied with their simple , understated lives . However , he manages to get through to Anakin , who is still being trained by Obi-Wan and is not a mature Jedi yet . Obi-Wan and the female Jedi character fail to convince Anakin to come back to the light side . Anakin defeats Obi-Wan in battle and is about to kill him , but is saved by the female Jedi student . Anakin sees this as a betrayal and kills her ( obviously this is all happening after the birth of their children ) . Obi-Wan , injured but still alive , hides Luke and Leia . Leia mentions in A New Hope that Obi-Wan fought with her father in the Clone Wars , so Obi-Wan was a Jedi working for her adoptive father , and the Clone Wars were some smaller scale interplanetary war between Alderaan and some other nearby planets that Obi-Wan had been a spy or warrior in . He searches for and finds an apathetic and defeated Yoda who has gone into hiding , lost all hope now that the other Jedi have been murdered . Yoda essentially cuts the cord with Obi-Wan and convinces him that the best thing to do is to go live out the rest of his days in peace away from the Empire 's grip . The two leave each other and lose contact . Obi-Wan decides to go stay on Tatooine and watch over the baby boy from afar . Cue A New Hope ...","`` I 'm sorry , I do n't know why I 've been doing this . '' I say to her . `` I 'd like to tell you something , but I 'll have to wait for you to finish your story . '' She says . I take a deep breath and begin . `` It 's about the first time I 's ever met you . '' `` Yes , I know . '' The girl nods , and I can see the look of confusion in her eyes . `` You 're not a girl , are you ? '' I ask . `` No , I 'vice versa . '' Her voice is calm , but she 's not sure if I 'M trying to be nice or if I just want to be polite . `` Well , I have to go . '' My voice is a little shaky , but it 's a good thing . `` What is it about you ? What 's so special about me ? '' `` You know , I was born in the year of the year , and you were born in about the year 2050 . '' That 's when I started to get the idea . `` That 'll be all . '' she says . `` So , how do I know that I 're a girl ? '' She asks . `` Because I ' have a long history of being a girl . '' **I 'm not a boy . ** `` Well ... '' I start . `` Oh , I see . I was a girl of about the age of 10 or 11 . '' *I 've always been a boy , but now I ' Am a girl ... * `` You were a girl then ? '' *Yes . * `` So you were a female ? '' The girls face is red and her eyes are red . `` Yes . '' We 're talking about the same age as me . `` How did you get here ? '' A young woman in a black dress walks up to me . She 's wearing a black suit and a black tie . `` The name 's Alice . '' It 'm my turn to look confused . `` Are you a boy ? '' she asks . I ' m confused . She looks at me , and she says , `` You are . '' And she 're right . `` But ... '' `` Shut up . '' '' I said . `` Now , I want to know why you 're here . '' Alice is a girl in a dress . `` Why are you here ? Why do you want to see me ? `` She looks really confused . I do not know . I have some history to tell . '' A man in a suit walks up . `` Where are you from ? '' He says . He 's tall , and he 's dark . `` A girl . I remember you . I used to be a girl once . '' He looks at her , and his face is all red . *I know . * I look at him . `` Remember that time I was trying to get you to go to the dance ? '' he says . *What ? * `` I was n't a girl ! '' I yell . `` Yeah . '' he responds . `` Wait , why are you doing this ? '' asked Alice . `` To get you out of the way . ''",5,0

AMT_Z2,"TITLE : THE MONEY MACHINE - Please give me feedback ! - Everyday , I could see it getting weaker and weaker . It 's processes lagged . It 's monitor was dim . I dusted its buttons off every single day , but a few hours later , it would just come back , as if I had never even been there . I knew it was inevitable-The ATM was dying . `` Fear not , my son . '' ATM said . `` We knew this day was coming , ever since you were a boy . Now here is your final payment . '' The ATM spat out $ 70,000 as its screen slowly faded to black . I could n't suppress the tears rolling down my face . I looked up to face the decrepit ATM . I had never known my parents . I 've been living on the streets for as long as I can remember . When I was seven years old , I joined a local gang . They always asked me to steal from local stores because I had skinny and fast . No one suspected the baby faced seven year old , which made stealing very easy . I had a family , food , and no cares in the world . At the time , it was a good life . I thought I could do this for the rest of my life , what a foolish thought that was . One day I stepped into a grocery store name Paldi 's with an empty stomach and bad judgement . As soon , as I walked in , I was greeted by employee . `` Why , hello there , little boy ! How can I- '' She froze as soon as I made eye contact with her . She said nothing more and quickly walked away . Even as a 7 year old , I should 've noticed how odd that was . But all I know was that I was hungry and the gang was hungry . My gang was full of teenage thugs , pimps and drug dealers . They were very cruel people , but they were always nice to me because I brought them food . I shuddered to think what would happen if I did n't deliver . I was collecting my usual round of Oreos , bread rolls , apples and candy when I saw a group of employees walking following me slowly . Again , this should of tipped me off , but when you ca n't think straight when you 're hungry sometimes . I was close to the exit , completely ignoring the manager and the employees getting angrier and angrier as if their presence should have been enough to make me reconsider my actions-which it should have been . I was pushing the shopping cart out of the door to the boys outside , waiting to collect every morsel of food in that cart . `` Alright , shorty ! '' A large boy called James said happily . `` We 're gon na eat good tonight . '' Another boy called Tom yelled . Suddenly , the boys widened their eyes at something behind me , and ran . A large , hairy hand grabbed my shoulder and lifted me up and turned me around . I was face to face with an angry , tomato faced bald man . `` YOU ZHINK YOU CAN STEAL FROM MOI '' The bald man thundered in a heavy French accent . I almost peed my pants , I had n't noticed the rusty pipe in his left hand . The female employee from before approached me . `` You think you could get away this for long ? '' She sneered . `` My sister warned me about you . '' The man drew his left hand back , winding up the pipe in his wrist . `` TAKE ZHIS ! '' The manager brought his left hand down with such strength , the air seemed to shift . I seriously doubted I would survive a blow like , so I screamed so loud the large man dropped his pipe . I took advantage of that-poking his eyes with my fingers . `` AHHH ! SACRE BLEU '' His hands instinctively rushed to his face , dropping me . I ran as fast as my little legs would carry me that day , but I soon realized that I was n't as fast as I thought I was . The manager quickly recovered and brought his entire gang of employees after me . And they were getting very close . `` I 'm only seven , do n't these dummy whores have anything better to do ? '' I muttered to myself . Yes , I know does n't make sense . My vocabulary at that time consisted of what I learned from middle school dropouts . Anyways , I only managed to stay about four feet ahead of them . I was running out of energy , so I ran into a dark alleyway , hoping that it led to somewhere . It did n't . It was a dead end , and I was completely exhausted . I had decided to except my fate when I heard a clicking noise . I snapped my head in the direction of the noise and say a bright scarlet ATM machine . I had a logo that I did n't recognize , so I went a little closer . As I was walking , something crumpled under my feet . A hundred dollar bill ! `` I 'm sure he went down this way ! '' I heard a female voice say . I dropped the bill and hid next to the ATM . On my way , there were at least 20 more hundred dollar bills on the floor . `` WHERE ARE YOU '' The manager and his gang had reached the end of alley , but I was hidden by the darkness . The manager suddenly looked down and screamed with delight . His employees did the same . Everyone shrieked with delight and started grabbing as much as they can , but the manager yelled at them . `` ARRETES . Give me za money . It will go to za store . '' The manager commanded . All the employees groaned and gave him all the money they collected . The manager grunted in satisfaction , and they all left . I sighed with relief , and I heard a deep voice behind me . `` I saved your life . You are indebted to me . '' I whirled around and saw the ATM 's screen flash to a bright white . The ATM was the one talking to me . `` I will give you money . Money will get you power in this world . Do you want money ? '' I nodded vigorously , too stunned to speak . `` You must never go back to that horrid band of miscreants you were with before , do you understand ? '' The ATM said sharply . I nodded again . I was n't too fund of them after James and Tom had ditched me . `` In ten years , I will die . '' The ATM continued . `` At that time , you will be 17 years old , and a billionaire , if you follow all of my instructions . '' `` Well , what are they ? '' `` I will start you out with 7,000 '' the ATM spat out a plethora of hundred dollar bills . `` Buy an apartment near here . That is your first task . After you do that , you will be receiving $ 70,000 from me every week as payment for your tasks . '' `` Alright . '' I began picking up the money . The ATM made a coughing sound . `` Those boys , '' he started . `` They will come after you and try to harm you . '' Use the rest of the money to buy a submachine gun . A man sells them in this alleyway on Thursday nights-come exactly at 8 or do n't come at all . '' I looked at the ATM in bewilderment . I was only seven , but i knew what he was implying . `` What ? ! ? ! '' I cried . `` I do n't like it either , '' The ATM said calmly . `` But I heard them was they ran past you . They WILL hurt you if they see you again . '' I dropped the money I was carrying and backed away . `` How do I know I can trust you ? '' `` You have no family and no friends . Do you really have many options ? '' The ATM retorted . I knew he was right . I sighed and began picking up the money . '' `` Do n't worry , '' The ATM said . `` This is only a one time thing . But you MUST stay alive for us to complete the mission , and they are a threat to your safety . Do you trust me , will you join me ? '' I stood up , and nodded at the ATM . `` Excellent . '' The ATM purred .","`` Did n't you have a birthmark on the back of your neck ? '' Amy said as she gently ran her fingers through my hair . `` Huh ? No , I do n't think so . '' Amy stopped her soft petting and stared quizzically at the back of my neck for quite some time before saying `` I 'm pretty sure you did . '' At this point , I was rather baffled . Amy and I have been dating for three years , and suddenly she 's decided to make up some sort of birth mark ? `` Amy , '' I said . `` Would n't I know if I had a birth mark or not ? '' `` Well , yes . I suppose you would . '' `` Then I can guarantee you that I have never had a birth mark . I can also guarantee you that I never will . '' `` Wait , '' she sputtered . `` Take off your shirt . '' `` Really ? I 'm not in the mood right now . '' `` I 'm not trying to have sex with you , just take off your shirt . '' `` Well , **now** I 'm a little disappointed . Fine . '' I took my shirt off . She snatched it out of my hands and threw it on the floor . I spun around to look at her , but she twisted my body back , making me face the mirrored cabinet again . `` What are you doing ? '' I asked . `` Just hold still , '' she replied . God , I loved her accent . There 's something so elegant about Brits that I ca n't seem to get over . `` Ha ! I knew you had a birth mark ! '' She ran her fingers down my spine and stopped a quarter of the way up my back , slightly off to the right . `` See ? '' she said spinning me around so I could look at my back in the cabinet . She was right , I had a rather large , yet faint , birthmark on my back . `` Okay , so what ? I do n't have one on my neck , I was just confused , '' I replied . `` You said you did n't have a birth mark . You lied . '' `` I told you , I was confused . What does it matter , anyway ? It 's just a birth mark . '' She sat in silence for a few moments before I saw her eyes widen . `` Is something wrong ? '' I asked , growing a little more than a little concerned about the condition of my back . What if , I thought , there is some nasty deformity that I had failed to notice . Or cancer . I 've already had a cancerous mole once , I 'm not looking forward to another . `` No . I do n't know . Maybe . '' She was growing more and more panicked -- it was n't obvious , but I could see it in her eyes . `` Is there any reason , '' she continued , `` that you would have a birth mark that says # 2903 ? '' `` 2903 ? '' Then , it hit me . All of the memories came rushing back -- the cancer , the chemo , the doctor telling me I was definitely not going to make it . And then , the last resort : I could clone myself . I could clone myself and be rid of the cancer -- any illnesses really , but there was one catch ... I 'm the clone , and the real me had to die .",4,5

'' ATM said . `` We knew this day was coming , ever since you were a boy . Now here is your final payment . '' The ATM spat out $ 70,000 as its screen slowly faded to black . I could n't suppress the tears rolling down my face . I looked up to face the decrepit ATM . I had never known my parents . I 've been living on the streets for as long as I can remember . When I was seven years old , I joined a local gang . They always asked me to steal from local stores because I had skinny and fast . No one suspected the baby faced seven year old , which made stealing very easy . I had a family , food , and no cares in the world . At the time , it was a good life . I thought I could do this for the rest of my life , what a foolish thought that was . One day I stepped into a grocery store name Paldi 's with an empty stomach and bad judgement . As soon , as I walked in , I was greeted by employee . `` Why , hello there , little boy ! How can I- '' She froze as soon as I made eye contact with her . She said nothing more and quickly walked away . Even as a 7 year old , I should 've noticed how odd that was . But all I know was that I was hungry and the gang was hungry . My gang was full of teenage thugs , pimps and drug dealers . They were very cruel people , but they were always nice to me because I brought them food . I shuddered to think what would happen if I did n't deliver . I was collecting my usual round of Oreos , bread rolls , apples and candy when I saw a group of employees walking following me slowly . Again , this should of tipped me off , but when you ca n't think straight when you 're hungry sometimes . I was close to the exit , completely ignoring the manager and the employees getting angrier and angrier as if their presence should have been enough to make me reconsider my actions-which it should have been . I was pushing the shopping cart out of the door to the boys outside , waiting to collect every morsel of food in that cart . `` Alright , shorty ! '' A large boy called James said happily . `` We 're gon na eat good tonight . '' Another boy called Tom yelled . Suddenly , the boys widened their eyes at something behind me , and ran . A large , hairy hand grabbed my shoulder and lifted me up and turned me around . I was face to face with an angry , tomato faced bald man . `` YOU ZHINK YOU CAN STEAL FROM MOI '' The bald man thundered in a heavy French accent . I almost peed my pants , I had n't noticed the rusty pipe in his left hand . The female employee from before approached me . `` You think you could get away this for long ?

The ATM was the one talking to me . `` I will give you money . Money will get you power in this world . Do you want money ? '' I nodded vigorously , too stunned to speak . `` You must never go back to that horrid band of miscreants you were with before , do you understand ? '' The ATM said sharply . I nodded again . I was n't too fund of them after James and Tom had ditched me . `` In ten years , I will die . '' The ATM continued . `` At that time , you will be 17 years old , and a billionaire , if you follow all of my instructions . '' `` Well , what are they ? '' `` I will start you out with 7,000 '' the ATM spat out a plethora of hundred dollar bills . `` Buy an apartment near here . That is your first task . After you do that , you will be receiving $ 70,000 from me every week as payment for your tasks . '' `` Alright . '' I began picking up the money . The ATM made a coughing sound . `` Those boys , '' he started . `` They will come after you and try to harm you . '' Use the rest of the money to buy a submachine gun . A man sells them in this alleyway on Thursday nights-come exactly at 8 or do n't come at all . '' I looked at the ATM in bewilderment . I was only seven , but i knew what he was implying . `` What ? ! ? ! '' I cried . `` I do n't like it either , '' The ATM said calmly . `` But I heard them was they ran past you . They WILL hurt you if they see you again . '' I dropped the money I was carrying and backed away . `` How do I know I can trust you ? '' `` You have no family and no friends . Do you really have many options ? '' The ATM retorted . I knew he was right . I sighed and began picking up the money . '' `` Do n't worry , '' The ATM said . `` This is only a one time thing . But you MUST stay alive for us to complete the mission , and they are a threat to your safety . Do you trust me , will you join me ? '' I stood up , and nodded at the ATM . `` Excellent . '' The ATM purred .","`` Did n't you have a birthmark on the back of your neck ? '' Amy said as she gently ran her fingers through my hair . `` Huh ? No , I do n't think so . '' Amy stopped her soft petting and stared quizzically at the back of my neck for quite some time before saying `` I 'm pretty sure you did . '' At this point , I was rather baffled . Amy and I have been dating for three years , and suddenly she 's decided to make up some sort of birth mark ? `` Amy , '' I said . `` Would n't I know if I had a birth mark or not ? '' `` Well , yes . I suppose you would . '' `` Then I can guarantee you that I have never had a birth mark . I can also guarantee you that I never will . '' `` Wait , '' she sputtered . `` Take off your shirt . '' `` Really ? I 'm not in the mood right now . '' `` I 'm not trying to have sex with you , just take off your shirt . '' `` Well , **now** I 'm a little disappointed . Fine . '' I took my shirt off . She snatched it out of my hands and threw it on the floor . I spun around to look at her , but she twisted my body back , making me face the mirrored cabinet again . `` What are you doing ? '' I asked . `` Just hold still , '' she replied . God , I loved her accent . There 's something so elegant about Brits that I ca n't seem to get over . `` Ha ! I knew you had a birth mark ! '' She ran her fingers down my spine and stopped a quarter of the way up my back , slightly off to the right . `` See ? '' she said spinning me around so I could look at my back in the cabinet . She was right , I had a rather large , yet faint , birthmark on my back . `` Okay , so what ? I do n't have one on my neck , I was just confused , '' I replied . `` You said you did n't have a birth mark . You lied . '' `` I told you , I was confused . What does it matter , anyway ? It 's just a birth mark . '' She sat in silence for a few moments before I saw her eyes widen . `` Is something wrong ? '' I asked , growing a little more than a little concerned about the condition of my back . What if , I thought , there is some nasty deformity that I had failed to notice . Or cancer . I 've already had a cancerous mole once , I 'm not looking forward to another . `` No . I do n't know . Maybe . '' She was growing more and more panicked -- it was n't obvious , but I could see it in her eyes . `` Is there any reason , '' she continued , `` that you would have a birth mark that says # 2903 ? '' `` 2903 ? '' Then , it hit me . All of the memories came rushing back -- the cancer , the chemo , the doctor telling me I was definitely not going to make it . And then , the last resort : I could clone myself . I could clone myself and be rid of the cancer -- any illnesses really , but there was one catch ... I 'm the clone , and the real me had to die .",5,5
AMT_8Z,"TITLE : THE MONEY MACHINE - Please give me feedback ! - Everyday , I could see it getting weaker and weaker . It 's processes lagged . It 's monitor was dim . I dusted its buttons off every single day , but a few hours later , it would just come back , as if I had never even been there . I knew it was inevitable-The ATM was dying . `` Fear not , my son . '' ATM said . `` We knew this day was coming , ever since you were a boy . Now here is your final payment . '' The ATM spat out $ 70,000 as its screen slowly faded to black . I could n't suppress the tears rolling down my face . I looked up to face the decrepit ATM . I had never known my parents . I 've been living on the streets for as long as I can remember . When I was seven years old , I joined a local gang . They always asked me to steal from local stores because I had skinny and fast . No one suspected the baby faced seven year old , which made stealing very easy . I had a family , food , and no cares in the world . At the time , it was a good life . I thought I could do this for the rest of my life , what a foolish thought that was . One day I stepped into a grocery store name Paldi 's with an empty stomach and bad judgement . As soon , as I walked in , I was greeted by employee . `` Why , hello there , little boy ! How can I- '' She froze as soon as I made eye contact with her . She said nothing more and quickly walked away . Even as a 7 year old , I should 've noticed how odd that was . But all I know was that I was hungry and the gang was hungry . My gang was full of teenage thugs , pimps and drug dealers . They were very cruel people , but they were always nice to me because I brought them food . I shuddered to think what would happen if I did n't deliver . I was collecting my usual round of Oreos , bread rolls , apples and candy when I saw a group of employees walking following me slowly . Again , this should of tipped me off , but when you ca n't think straight when you 're hungry sometimes . I was close to the exit , completely ignoring the manager and the employees getting angrier and angrier as if their presence should have been enough to make me reconsider my actions-which it should have been . I was pushing the shopping cart out of the door to the boys outside , waiting to collect every morsel of food in that cart . `` Alright , shorty ! '' A large boy called James said happily . `` We 're gon na eat good tonight . '' Another boy called Tom yelled . Suddenly , the boys widened their eyes at something behind me , and ran . A large , hairy hand grabbed my shoulder and lifted me up and turned me around . I was face to face with an angry , tomato faced bald man . `` YOU ZHINK YOU CAN STEAL FROM MOI '' The bald man thundered in a heavy French accent . I almost peed my pants , I had n't noticed the rusty pipe in his left hand . The female employee from before approached me . `` You think you could get away this for long ? '' She sneered . `` My sister warned me about you . '' The man drew his left hand back , winding up the pipe in his wrist . `` TAKE ZHIS ! '' The manager brought his left hand down with such strength , the air seemed to shift . I seriously doubted I would survive a blow like , so I screamed so loud the large man dropped his pipe . I took advantage of that-poking his eyes with my fingers . `` AHHH ! SACRE BLEU '' His hands instinctively rushed to his face , dropping me . I ran as fast as my little legs would carry me that day , but I soon realized that I was n't as fast as I thought I was . The manager quickly recovered and brought his entire gang of employees after me . And they were getting very close . `` I 'm only seven , do n't these dummy whores have anything better to do ? '' I muttered to myself . Yes , I know does n't make sense . My vocabulary at that time consisted of what I learned from middle school dropouts . Anyways , I only managed to stay about four feet ahead of them . I was running out of energy , so I ran into a dark alleyway , hoping that it led to somewhere . It did n't . It was a dead end , and I was completely exhausted . I had decided to except my fate when I heard a clicking noise . I snapped my head in the direction of the noise and say a bright scarlet ATM machine . I had a logo that I did n't recognize , so I went a little closer . As I was walking , something crumpled under my feet . A hundred dollar bill ! `` I 'm sure he went down this way ! '' I heard a female voice say . I dropped the bill and hid next to the ATM . On my way , there were at least 20 more hundred dollar bills on the floor . `` WHERE ARE YOU '' The manager and his gang had reached the end of alley , but I was hidden by the darkness . The manager suddenly looked down and screamed with delight . His employees did the same . Everyone shrieked with delight and started grabbing as much as they can , but the manager yelled at them . `` ARRETES . Give me za money . It will go to za store . '' The manager commanded . All the employees groaned and gave him all the money they collected . The manager grunted in satisfaction , and they all left . I sighed with relief , and I heard a deep voice behind me . `` I saved your life . You are indebted to me . '' I whirled around and saw the ATM 's screen flash to a bright white . The ATM was the one talking to me . `` I will give you money . Money will get you power in this world . Do you want money ?

AMT_Z2,"A harsh suckle infiltrated Orville 's bramble-like ear hair . He noticed Harold 's mouth hanging off his arm . `` What 's that ? EHHH ! '' Orville smacked the top of Harold 's head . Harold 's feeble jaw released as he stumbled about a foot backwards . Like a rusted spring , Harold 's octogenarian legs diverted his body back at Orville . Harold slowly raised both hands and moaned at his target through his dentureless mouth . Orville confused the moans as a retaliatory scream . Harold sluggishly made a gravity-assisted lunge at Orville . Thinking on his spry , 86 year old feet , he planted his stance and lifted up his cane , redirecting his zombified friend . Harold tumbled to the ground at a falling balloons pace , landing squarely on his leg . It was his ~~bad~~ worse leg , and after the collision Harold futilely tried to get up . Orville stared , his mind attempting to catch up with the incredible pace of the past two actions . Meanwhile , Harold gummed at the jogging pants armor on Orville 's leg . Orville 's senile appraisal of the situation came back empty . As he usually did when he found himself in these frequent moments of disorientation , he tried to avoid potentially having to answer any questions by ignoring the whole thing and changing the subject . `` Quitting being a goof Harold ! We have to make it to The JC Penny by 9:05 ! Their coupons for this month expire today , so we need to be the first customers to beat the check-out lineups ! '' Harold was unable to get up , but his undead gums continued to suck Orville 's pants like a clogged vacuum . Orville pulled his leg away and Harold moaned an elderly , raspy grumble . The garage entrance to the mall and the side staff entrance were already open , but all the stores remained locked with their cage and plexi-glass security doors . Attracted by Harold 's undead groans , two employees of a nearby clothing store stumbled in the wails direction with their zombie gaits . The first bounced off the display window , setting off a domino-chain of falling mannequins which created an audibly offensive percussion orchestra that echoed throughout the empty mall , attracting more creatures . Out of a nearby washroom came squeaked a mop bucket being pushed by a one-armed pale custodian who had vomit dripping down his mouth and shirt . Close behind was a girl in a hotdog stand uniform , chewing on the custodians severed arm . From the direction Orville and Harold had been walking , a mall security guard was riding in an topless golf cart , but it ’ s rubber tire gripped the wall , riding it all the way past Orville and Harold . Orville looked around . “ Harold , look at this . Now all these snot-nose kids are tinkerin ’ in our buisness . You ’ re 80 ! You don ’ t need a damn nurse yet ! Get up , you baby ! ” He turned to the custodian . “ Don ’ t need no help thanks ! l All Fine ! Tying his shoe ! ^Don ’ t embarass us Harold ! ” As the hot-dog girl and custodian staggered closer and Harold incessantly groaned on the floor Orville began to notice that they weren ’ t coming to help Harold , but were coming straight for himself . “ Hey ! He ’ s the one attacked me ! He ’ s half-Jap , and I have them veterans reflexes. ” Orville clenched his cane as the two got closer . At that moment the security guards buggy hit a sharp corner , which reoriented him in Orvilles direction . Orville saw the guard approaching , and he stepped to the side and he wound up his cane in anticipation . Nine heart-racing seconds later the vehicle was within cane ’ s length and Orville swung at the passing guard . The guard fell off the back , but Orville hooked the steering wheel with the handle of his cane ! It pulled Orville a few inches where he tripped over the ground-flailing Harold and landed miraculously into the drivers position of the vehicle . Orville ’ s mind hadn ’ t caught up to his reflexive instincts and he tried piecing the previous few moments together as he coasted down the mall . “ What was I doi… Oh yeah . The JC Penny. ” Orville checked his watch , 9:02 . *Harold will just have to meet me there , * Orville thought to himself . The front doors of the mall unlocked automatically at 9AM , letting in a sea of zombie shoppers . Orville drove the car down the mall , rolling over the undead shoppers as he advanced towards his destination . “ Use a sidewalk , hippies ! ”","`` We have been waiting for you for so long , '' the voice came from the radio . `` I 've been waiting to hear you . '' `` I know , '' I replied . `` My name is John . I 'm from the future , and I 'll be here for you . I can hear you now . '' I looked around the room , expecting to see my friends . Instead , I saw a group of people , all dressed in black . They were all looking at me , smiling , and they were all smiling . `` We 've waited so long for you , '' they said . `` But you 've never been here , '' said one of them . `` You 've always been a bit of a mystery to me , '' replied the other . `` And you 're here now , '' he said . I looked up at them . They all looked at me . `` What do you mean ? '' I asked . `` Well , '' one of the people said . He was dressed in a suit and tie . `` It 's a big deal . I do n't know why you 'd be here , but I 'd like to see you . You 're from the present , '' another said . They both nodded . `` Yeah , '' John said . The other man nodded . He looked around . `` Where are we ? '' `` We were supposed to be here in the future . '' The man said . There was a pause . `` Do you know why ? '' The other one asked . I nodded . The man looked at the man . `` Are you sure ? '' He asked . The second man nodded , and the first man nodded again . `` Then we 're going to be there , '' answered the second man . I turned to the first one . `` So , are you sure you want to come ? '' he asked . He smiled . `` Of course , '' she said . She turned to me . She was smiling . I took a step towards the door . `` Come on , '' my friend said . We walked through the door , and we stepped into the room . `` This is where we 'll meet , '' we said . Everyone looked at us . `` Who are you ? '' the man asked . We looked at each other . He asked me , `` What 's your name ? '' We did n't answer . `` John , '' then I said . My friend smiled .

'' `` Where are you ? '' `` We are going to run . '' The second message was , `` Run , run , run . You are going down . '' My heart raced . I could n't believe it . The phone was n't even ringing . I got out of bed and ran out the door . I ran down the street , and ran down one of the streets , but I did n't know where I was going . I had to run to the next street , but that was a long way . I went down a street , I ran to the other side of the street . I saw a person walking down the other road . I did my best to run past , but it was n're he was n' t . I stopped and looked at him . He was wearing a black hoodie . I was n ' t sure what was going on , but he looked like he was wearing some sort of mask . He had a gun on his hip . I pulled my phone out and looked it over . I 'd never seen a picture like this before . I knew what I was doing . I opened the phone . I glanced at the message . `` run '' `` run ... '' I read the message again . I read it again . ``Run '' ``Run ... '' ``run ... '' The message was finally over . ``run '' `` ... '' As I read over the messages I could tell I was in a good place . I began to feel better . I walked over to the man who was standing there . I felt like I was at home . I reached for the gun . `` It 's ok . '' He said . I pushed the gun to my head . `` I 'm sorry , I 'll be right back . '' As he walked away , I looked down at my wrist and saw a picture . It was me . I took a deep breath , and looked up at the man . He looked at me . `` You are n't going to do anything . '' His eyes were wide . He started to cry . `` No . I ca n't . '' And that 's when I saw it . I turned around and saw the gun in his hand . I started to run , and I heard a gunshot . I heard the man screaming . I jumped to the side and ran . I can feel the gun pointing at me , but the gun is n't turning . I look down at the gun and see the gun laying on the ground . I see the man standing there , blood everywhere . `` Get up . ''","“ Dr . Garyson , you have five seconds to cut to the chase and explain what ’ s happening here . Why are we so damn hairy ? ” Dr. Grayson sputtered a bit . He ’ d carefully prepared notes that would accurately convey the biochemical changes that had stricken humanity in the past week while still being understandable to the layperson . As of right now , that was primarily this idiot general . After gathering his thoughts for a moment , pausing for several seconds just to spite the general , Dr. Grayson continued , “ First off General Douglas , it ’ s not really hair . Here , take this. ” Dr. Grayson handed the general a small propane torch off his work station . He pointed at the general ’ s arm , “ Light the torch and point it at your arm. ” A flicker of rage flashed across the general ’ s face , “ If this is some sort of joke I ’ ll have your- “ “ It ’ s quite safe . I assure you . I 've done it several times already , ” said Dr. Grayson , cutting off the general . Still glowering , the general sparked the torch and quickly passed it over his arm . Nothing happened . No smoke , no sulfur stench , nothing . The general passed the torch over his arm again , going a bit slower this time . Still , nothing happened . He held the torch over one spot on his left forearm . He held it there a full thirty seconds before turning off the torch and handing it back to the doctor . “ It is n't even warm , ” said the general , shock at the edge of his voice . Dr. Grayson took the torch , “ Yes , I noticed that last week when I spilled a cup of fresh coffee on myself . You see , it ’ s not really hair . It ’ s some sort of carbon nanotube structure , about four hundred nanometers in diameter , packed with some sort of protein that can transduce thermal energy . '' `` The protein converts infrared radiation into electrical potential that ’ s stored between the individual strands . Just FYI , careful when you leave the room , you ’ re going to get a hell of a shock when you touch the metal doorknob , ” said the doctor with a small smirk , and then continued , “ Also , something you , or really anyone of the belligerent persuasion , may find interesting is that the stuff weaves together if you don ’ t brush it . Looks matted and gross as hell , but I think it ’ ll behave a lot like Kevlar . You could be stopping bullets with your chest hair right now. ” The general ignored Dr. Grayson , instead studying his shaggy arm hair , but after a moment he came out of it . “ What about the other enhancements ? ” he asked . “ I was getting to that before your question , ” said Dr. Grayson , taking a subtle dig at the general , “ The enhancements , as you call them , are , on the hole , beneficial in almost every way but one . The enhanced strength appears to come from an enhanced form of the myosin protein . Nothing too exotic , I ’ m sure evolution could have cooked this up , but not in a week. ” Dr. Grayson took a seat on his lab bench , “ The eye sight and hearing are the same story , basically upgraded versions of proteins that already existed , '' he said , `` Couple changes to the digestive tract , they seem to bolster our ability to absorb nutrients into our gut wall . We 've also seen an explosion in gut microbes . It ’ s entirely possible we 've gained the ability to digest cellulose. ” “ Meaning ? ” asked the general . “ We could probably start eating grass if we wanted , ” replied Dr. Grayson , “ though I don ’ t think there 've been any changes to help the taste. ” The general nodded , “ You mentioned a change that was n't beneficial ? ” Dr. Grayson shrugged , “ It ’ s not a change so much as a consequence of the ones we 've already seen . You see , these changes make our bodies far more robust , but it comes at a nutritional cost . Whereas before we would be looking at one to three thousand calories a day , we ’ re now looking at around nine to twelve thousand . It may not affect us here in the first world , but where people are already starving… ” the doctor shrugged again , “ things could get pretty bad , or worse , I should say. ” The general nodded yet again , and then began to pace for a bit . Dr. Grayson watched him , wondering if the meeting was at an end . He ’ d have left , but it was his lab , when the general turned back to him , “ I have to say Dr. Grayson , I ’ m extremely impressed with your work . You 've accomplished more in a week than any of the other teams working on the recent changes , so I ’ m going to bump you up a security clearance and bring you on full time . We ’ ll be leaving for a CIA black site in an hour . We ’ ll send someone to pick you up , and get you somewhere safe , ” the general turned to leave . Dr. Grayson nearly fell off the stool jumping to follow the general , “ WOAH ! Hold up there , general ! What do you mean leave ? I ’ m heavily invested here ! ” The doctor stopped in his tracks with a sudden realization . He then called after the general , “ What do you mean ‘ safe ’ ! ? ” he started running again out into the hall after the general . The general turned back , letting the doctor catch up . Quietly , he said , “ We 've found something . Something out near the orbit of Mars , and it is coming here , ” the general fixed the doctor with his cold gaze , “ We 've found ourselves with a lot of questions this week , and so far you ’ re the only one to give us any answers. ” The general began to walk towards the building ’ s exit again , “ If that does n't make you one of the best of us , I don ’ t know what does . Your country needs you , son , ” he reached the door , “ Hell , the world needs you. ” The door swung shut .",0,5

'' As he walked away , I looked down at my wrist and saw a picture . It was me . I took a deep breath , and looked up at the man . He looked at me . `` You are n't going to do anything . '' His eyes were wide . He started to cry . `` No . I ca n't . '' And that 's when I saw it . I turned around and saw the gun in his hand . I started to run , and I heard a gunshot . I heard the man screaming . I jumped to the side and ran . I can feel the gun pointing at me , but the gun is n't turning . I look down at the gun and see the gun laying on the ground . I see the man standing there , blood everywhere . `` Get up . ''","“ Dr . Garyson , you have five seconds to cut to the chase and explain what ’ s happening here . Why are we so damn hairy ? ” Dr. Grayson sputtered a bit . He ’ d carefully prepared notes that would accurately convey the biochemical changes that had stricken humanity in the past week while still being understandable to the layperson . As of right now , that was primarily this idiot general . After gathering his thoughts for a moment , pausing for several seconds just to spite the general , Dr. Grayson continued , “ First off General Douglas , it ’ s not really hair . Here , take this. ” Dr. Grayson handed the general a small propane torch off his work station . He pointed at the general ’ s arm , “ Light the torch and point it at your arm. ” A flicker of rage flashed across the general ’ s face , “ If this is some sort of joke I ’ ll have your- “ “ It ’ s quite safe . I assure you . I 've done it several times already , ” said Dr. Grayson , cutting off the general . Still glowering , the general sparked the torch and quickly passed it over his arm . Nothing happened . No smoke , no sulfur stench , nothing . The general passed the torch over his arm again , going a bit slower this time . Still , nothing happened . He held the torch over one spot on his left forearm . He held it there a full thirty seconds before turning off the torch and handing it back to the doctor . “ It is n't even warm , ” said the general , shock at the edge of his voice . Dr. Grayson took the torch , “ Yes , I noticed that last week when I spilled a cup of fresh coffee on myself . You see , it ’ s not really hair . It ’ s some sort of carbon nanotube structure , about four hundred nanometers in diameter , packed with some sort of protein that can transduce thermal energy . '' `` The protein converts infrared radiation into electrical potential that ’ s stored between the individual strands . Just FYI , careful when you leave the room , you ’ re going to get a hell of a shock when you touch the metal doorknob , ” said the doctor with a small smirk , and then continued , “ Also , something you , or really anyone of the belligerent persuasion , may find interesting is that the stuff weaves together if you don ’ t brush it . Looks matted and gross as hell , but I think it ’ ll behave a lot like Kevlar . You could be stopping bullets with your chest hair right now. ” The general ignored Dr. Grayson , instead studying his shaggy arm hair , but after a moment he came out of it . “ What about the other enhancements ? ” he asked . “ I was getting to that before your question , ” said Dr. Grayson , taking a subtle dig at the general , “ The enhancements , as you call them , are , on the hole , beneficial in almost every way but one . The enhanced strength appears to come from an enhanced form of the myosin protein . Nothing too exotic , I ’ m sure evolution could have cooked this up , but not in a week. ” Dr. Grayson took a seat on his lab bench , “ The eye sight and hearing are the same story , basically upgraded versions of proteins that already existed , '' he said , `` Couple changes to the digestive tract , they seem to bolster our ability to absorb nutrients into our gut wall . We 've also seen an explosion in gut microbes . It ’ s entirely possible we 've gained the ability to digest cellulose. ” “ Meaning ? ” asked the general . “ We could probably start eating grass if we wanted , ” replied Dr. Grayson , “ though I don ’ t think there 've been any changes to help the taste. ” The general nodded , “ You mentioned a change that was n't beneficial ? ” Dr. Grayson shrugged , “ It ’ s not a change so much as a consequence of the ones we 've already seen . You see , these changes make our bodies far more robust , but it comes at a nutritional cost . Whereas before we would be looking at one to three thousand calories a day , we ’ re now looking at around nine to twelve thousand . It may not affect us here in the first world , but where people are already starving… ” the doctor shrugged again , “ things could get pretty bad , or worse , I should say. ” The general nodded yet again , and then began to pace for a bit . Dr. Grayson watched him , wondering if the meeting was at an end . He ’ d have left , but it was his lab , when the general turned back to him , “ I have to say Dr. Grayson , I ’ m extremely impressed with your work . You 've accomplished more in a week than any of the other teams working on the recent changes , so I ’ m going to bump you up a security clearance and bring you on full time . We ’ ll be leaving for a CIA black site in an hour . We ’ ll send someone to pick you up , and get you somewhere safe , ” the general turned to leave . Dr. Grayson nearly fell off the stool jumping to follow the general , “ WOAH ! Hold up there , general ! What do you mean leave ? I ’ m heavily invested here ! ” The doctor stopped in his tracks with a sudden realization . He then called after the general , “ What do you mean ‘ safe ’ ! ? ” he started running again out into the hall after the general . The general turned back , letting the doctor catch up . Quietly , he said , “ We 've found something . Something out near the orbit of Mars , and it is coming here , ” the general fixed the doctor with his cold gaze , “ We 've found ourselves with a lot of questions this week , and so far you ’ re the only one to give us any answers. ” The general began to walk towards the building ’ s exit again , “ If that does n't make you one of the best of us , I don ’ t know what does . Your country needs you , son , ” he reached the door , “ Hell , the world needs you. ” The door swung shut .",2,4

I 'd love to hear what you think !","It ’ s one of those mindless things you do , you know ? You walk to the same old lady at the canteen , absent-mindedly handing her the exact amount for your standard daily breakfast . You skirt round the same building every morning to get to where you need to be . You grunt in acknowledgement when your wife tells you about her day . We lived in an apartment on the thirty-seventh floor . The air was breezy and the view was great . We had no children , but we were happy just the way it was . Until we weren ’ t . The old lady at the canteen passed away six months ago . When you heard the news from her co-worker , you must have felt something . But you were in a rush and hastily handed your money over , as usual . Different person , same routine . All of a sudden , someone you saw almost daily was no longer there .

AMT_1U,"`` You 're not going to believe this , but you are ! '' The sword , a longsword , was sitting on the ground . It was the last weapon I had ever seen . It had been my father 's , and he had given it to me . It 's a relic of a time when I was a young boy . He had taken it to the hall , and given it back to me when I had come to my father , and told me it was the sword that would save my life . It would save him . I did n't know what to do .

I had to go to the castle , and find the sword . It did n restarted the war , and the war is over . I have n't seen the sword in years . I 'm not sure if it is still there , or if I have left it behind , but I have not seen it since . I am the last one . I ran into the hall . The sword was n't there . I looked around the room , and saw nothing . I walked over to the door , and looked at it . I thought it was a trap , but it was n assurely not . It opened , and a figure stepped out . I was n Phelps . I knew he was the only one who had seen the weapon , and as I looked at him , I knew that he was nassing for the sword to come to me , but he was too far away . I saw the sword and I knew it was gone . I turned around , and walked back to the room where I had found the sword before . I never saw it again . I went back to my room , where I found the weapon . I took the sword out of my bag , and put it on the floor . I put it to my head . I heard a noise , and suddenly I felt a lightening bolt . I felt the sword shoot out of the ground , and then I felt it hit the ground again . It hit the floor , and my eyes widened . I watched the sword fly off the floor and out of existence . I grabbed the sword from the ground and threw it at the wall . I stood up , and ran towards the door . I jumped up , but the sword was gone , and that is when I heard it . The sound of the sword striking the ground was deafening . I dropped the sword as it hit , and felt it 's force pull me into the room . I tried to run , but my legs were weak . I fell to the ground as I felt my body being pulled into the dark room . The door slammed shut , and there was nothing . There was nothing in the room that I could see . I lay on the dirt , and was surprised to see the sword sitting on a table . It looked like it was holding a sword , but there was naught in it . No one else was there . There were no other weapons in the hall that I saw . I opened the door to the Hall of the Dead , and found a man , and his sword . He was a tall , dark man , with a long beard , and dark eyes . He looked at me , and said , `` I am not here to kill you , but to be the one to save you . '' I looked down at the sword on the table , and thought , `` It is my duty to be your savior . '' `` I 'll be the first one to die , '' I said . I pulled the sword back from the table . The man looked at the weapon and said `` I do not have a weapon . ''","A day 's worth of procrastinating and dreaming left me regretfully unsatisfied . Why did I continue to do avoid my priorities if I felt so bad about not doing them ? Would n't my life be more achieving if I just did what I told myself I was going to do ? Easier said then done I suppose . A knock came from the other side of my door while I was reciting my typical Thursday night of doing nothing more than playing video games and being lazy . The brief sound made me jump from my seat . I was n't used to getting any visitors at anytime , let alone this time of the night . Convinced my mind was just playing tricks on me I switched my attention back to my TV . Another knock , another sudden turn of my head towards the entrance . This time it was real . I trembled to my feet and cautiously walked towards the door . All sorts of possibilities of what will happen next racing through my head . `` Who 's ... who 's there ? '' my eerie voice gave away my vulnerability . `` You . '' A familiar voice answered immediately . My body and mind paused . `` Who ? '' `` It 's you . '' The voice was calm and confident in contrast to mine . `` I 'm sorry , I do n't know anybody named You . '' Why did I say that . `` My name is Harrison Baldt Jorgerforsson . My mother died when I was five and I was raised by my father and his multiple girlfriends in San Francisco . I like football and basketball and played it until my senior year of highschool . I enjoy reading , bicycling and absolutely love movies . '' How could this be ? Was I being confronted by my own impostor ? Surely some prank was being pulled on me by some lonely no life college kids . Everything he said was about me was true . `` What was the name of my second grade teacher ? '' I responded , secretly intrigued by the game the man was playing with me . `` Miss . Harden . '' He answered in a heartbeat . `` Okay ... .good research you did there . Who was my first kiss ? '' I had him tricked now . The only person in the whole world who knew who my first kiss was is the girl herself . `` Emily Dober , sixth grade , behind the bleachers . '' He was right . My jaw dropped as had no idea how to go forth with this situation . We shared a brief moment of silence before curiosity got the best me . In a cautious tone I opened the door only to see my eyes staring right back at me . I was staring a reflection , a perfect resembling duplicate of myself . As if I was staring at a mirror . He was smiling at me like he knew exactly what my face would look like when I saw him . We maintained eye contact with each other for a long and awkward time and shared the silence of the night outside . `` Hello Harry . '' The man said . I was convinced what I was seeing was not real . That this surreal and enigmatic moment was not happening . My eyes were questioning all of the logical knowledge that I had accumulated throughout the years . Perhaps my sense of feel would bring me back to reality . With a shaky hand and still sharing eye contact , I patted the mans right shoulder and examined it . The man who claims was me was as real as the sun in the sky , or birds singing in a park . `` I 've come to take over Harry . '' The man cautioned .",4,5

AMT_OV,"The writer picked up his old Moleskine journal , it ’ s binding coming undone and the back cover hanging off . He had recently been going through his old stuff from his high school days , looking for things to throw away to make room for new things . He took a deep breath , preparing himself for the worst , sat down at his desk , and opened the journal . Sloppy , smeared handwriting greeted him inside . Line after line of his nearly indecipherable scrawling text . Dialogue , setting , paragraphs . He looked over it with pangs of nostalgia , and just a touch of embarrassment . This was some of his early work . And it was absolutely horrible . But it was his , so he kept it . All these years , in the back of his closet , waiting for him . He flipped through the pages , remembering what it was like to write all this out , sitting on his bed in his old family home . He was so young back then . So naïve . He read through everything he had written , slogged through the awkward love scenes between the main character he based on himself and the female character he based on his then girlfriend . Their messy breakup was one of the main reasons he stopped writing this story . He learned a lesson then . Never base characters completely off of people you know . He got to the end , and being a sentimental sap , wrote a note on the page where he left off . I ’ m sorry to do this to you . I really am . You know how much effort I put into this . You were there , every step of the way . I thought about your story every day , and I was really excited about it . But I had no idea what I was doing back then . I just rushed into this , having no plans about where the plot was going , not even knowing what the plot was in the first place . It was a rookie effort at best . But I ’ ve gotten better . I ’ ve started a new project , one that actually has a plot . It ’ s going to be a long haul , but I think it ’ ll make it big . So thank you , for being my first big failure . Because without you , I never would have gotten to where I am now . -M He put down his pen and smiled . He was closing the book , when something caught his eye on the last page . He opened it back up to reveal that a message was appearing below the one he had just written . A rookie effort ? Your first big failure ? That ’ s all we are to you ? Is that really what you think ? You created us , and now you toss us aside like garbage . You never cared about us . And now you ’ re going to throw us away . -D Startled , the writer sat there for a while , looking at the note that had been written . The handwriting wasn ’ t his , not even close , so it couldn ’ t have been something that he had written and somehow hadn ’ t seen . Besides that , he told himself , this is clearly referencing what I just wrote . He decided to write back , see if there was another response . Maybe his mind was just playing tricks on him . He picked his pen back up and began to write again . I said I was sorry . I am sorry . But I couldn ’ t continue with this story after the breakup , you know that . There was too much in here based on Emily , and after we split , I couldn ’ t bring myself to continue writing about her . -M Well maybe you should 've thought of that before you started writing about us . You took a huge risk , and it did n't pay off , and you just blew us off when it became “ too hard ” for you . You 're selfish . You 're weak . You 're a terrible writer . -D The writer sighed and rubbed his eyes , growing tired of this back and forth with someone who 's stuck in the mindset of a high school freshman . Alright , look . I understand where you 're coming from and what you 're thinking . I created you . And I know you feel abandoned , because you think you 're all alone . You think nbody really understands you . You think you 're the only one who really “ gets it ” . But heads up ; you 're not . There are people out there who could understand you , who could help you , but you do n't reach out to them because you hold your standards too high . And now you 're alone . Not because of me , but because of you . You made yourself alone . And now your time is up . Goodbye . -M The writer signed his initial , closed the journal , and leaned back from his desk . He sat there for a while , staring at the journal . After a while , he stood up , took the journal off of his desk , and walked into his kitchen . He rummaged around in his kitchen drawers until he found what he was looking for ; a book of matches . He took the matches and the journal and walked to his back door . He stepped outside , into the warm summer evening air . The sun was setting , and the wind was still . Perfect night for a little fire , the writer thought to himself . He placed the journal on the ground , and opened it up to a blank page . He struck a match , and dropped it onto the open pages of the journal . It did n't take long for it to ignite , and soon it was burning nicely , the fire crackling and smoking . The writer smiled to himself , and looked into the sunset . He stood there like that until the sun went all the way down below the mountains , and then looked down at what remained of the journal . There was a scorched area of his stone patio , but he did n't mind too much . The journal was a pile of ashes now , smoldering weakly . He stamped them out with his foot , leaving nothing burning The writer thought to himself that it was oddly poetic , what he had done . He ’ d destroyed his work , but at the same time , had destroyed an old part of himself , a part that he wasn ’ t necessarily proud of anymore . He felt rejuvenated , revitalized , like a phoenix who had just been born again from ash . A fitting metaphor , he thought with a smile , as he walked back inside his house . He shut the door , and turned out the patio lights . The pile of ash sat there , until the wind began to pick up . Slowly , the pile began to get smaller , as the ash was carried away into the air . Eventually , as the writer lay asleep in his bed , the last of the ashes disappeared , blown off in the breeze . And in that moment , the writer and Daniel , his creation , both knew peace .","Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Let ? He smirked . By let , is is of course meant that Mozzie did n't resist being shoved into the wall . With his hands bound before him and his body bruised and burnt from the torture , let was a very subjective word . So , Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Mozzie let Haddock shove him toward the hole he 'd blown in the back of the citadel . Mozzie even let him slam the butt of his rifle into his kidney when Mozzie did n't move fast enough . Grave robbing was n't really Mozzie 's thing . He liked mysteries and liked being the one to solve them . When Haddock first came to him with the spear haft , the engravings upon it had n't meant much , but when Haddock inferred that that the engravings were part of a map a conquistador had made after leaving El Dorado , Mozzie could n't resist . He 'd scanned it , projected it , stretched it out into two dimensional print outs , tested the metal of the spear head , identified the wood in the haft , compared the inscriptions , and hit up Spain for the opportunity to search for the spear section in their historical records . After all that , his break came from a Redditor who 's father had once worked security for a museum in Chicago . And thanks to that tip , Mozzie was able to locate the rest of the spear and even the helm that completed the map and provided the key . `` Move . '' Haddock snapped , jabbing the barrel of his rifle into the fatty part of Mozzie 's thigh . `` I-I am . '' Mozzie called back . The place is full of spider webs and the damn floor is uneven . `` I . . . said move . '' Haddock growled , jabbing him again . `` Dammit , if I twist my ankle or break my fucking leg , then you 're going to have to carry me through this shitty place to unlock the door . So , let me pick my way on my own and just follow me . I 'm bound and bruised and beaten . What the fuck . Just stop jabbing me . '' Mozzie could n't really see Haddock 's face , but the glass eye in his right socket twinkled with unholy light . Haddock wiped his brow with a handkerchief , grunted , then responded to Mozzie 's reasonable sounding rant by firing a shot into the tunnel floor right between Mozzie 's feet . Mozzie swore and went back to trail blazing the spider infested tunnel . He stopped when the floor of the tunnel spread out and the ceiling raised and the corridor went from a barrel vaulted construct to tall rectangular chamber . Mozzie stopped and shined his light upon the floor . They had glyphs etched into them . `` Move ! '' Haddock called . `` Stop . I think the floor 's booby trapped . '' Mozzie reasoned . Haddock squeezed up beside Mozzie and looked at the floor . `` How ? '' Haddock did n't talk much , but when he did , brevity was solemnly embraced . `` Not sure . I 've researched these types of traps before . Some of the panels are , some of them are thin clay plates . Step on the wrong one , and your foot plunges through and trips what ever trigger lies below it . Haddock glared at him . `` Sorry . I do n't know what traps the triggers will set off . There 's no way of knowing . '' Haddock grunted and slid back into the tunnel . A moment later one of the local thugs he 'd brought was pressed in to the mouth of the tunnel beside me . `` What want , boss ? '' The thug asked . `` Kill snakes . '' Haddock ordered , catching Mozzie 's eye . The thug frowned , but pulled out his machete . He gave the prisoner a quick glance and marched out into the chamber ahead of them . His third step punched through a tile . There was the echoing hiss in the walls , and from above a tiny pebble fell on the henchmen 's head and bounced off . He looked up just in time to catch the three inch spear in the small of his throat . It slammed to a stop about a foot from the floor , impaling the man who hung suspended on the spike . `` Go . '' Haddock ordered . As they moved forward , Haddock would probe the tiles with the end of his rifle . Sometimes the tiles would break away and nothing happened , and sometimes they 'd break away and trip the trigger and let another pole slam down before them . By the time they reached the far side of the corridor , a safe path had been found and marked for their return . Mozzie was made to wait while the rest of the henchmen made their way across . Mozzie filled that time by studying the next corridor . It was taller and narrower , but just as dark and there were glyphs on the walls like those on the floor . The floor in the corridor was tiled much like the chamber had been . The only difference he saw was the glyphs engraved on these floor tiles were all the same and , he recognized them . `` What of these ? '' Haddock asked . `` They warn the proud man to be humble . '' Mozzie replied . `` A psalm perhaps . '' Mozzie noticed the holes near the tiles in the wall and noticed their height from the ground . `` Trap ? '' Haddock probed at one of the tiles , it did nothing . `` Maybe . Perhaps they seek to make us comfortable with the uniform warning on all the tiles . I 'll keep watch on the floor to see if any of them change . You do the same with the tiles on the wall . If you see a change in any of the glyphs let me know . Haddock 's reply was another grunt and a prod from the rifle barrel . Mozzie moved forward , cringing in fear that his play would be discovered , but Haddock came in proud like his henchmen and kept his one good eye on the tiles on the wall . Half way down the corridor , a tile tilts under Mozzie 's foot and the sound of a click was the only warning before the spikes slammed out from the sides of the tunnel all at heart and head 's height . Haddock weakly struggled as he was pierced from both sides . The many of the henchmen cried out , but some did n't . One of them in the back had stooped down just a moment before the blades slid out and in his panic to escape the trap , he stumbled back into the chamber and promptly stepped through a clay tile and was impaled as the first henchman had been . Mozzie leaned against the tunnel wall and wept for what he 'd done . He suspected what the nature of the trap would be . All he had to say was for them to keep low and they would all make it through safely . He 'd seen Haddock kill men before , and despite his callous disregard for life , he 'd always made it quick and painless . Mozzie was a scholar . He was the adventuring kind . He was n't fighter . He was n't a soldier . He 'd never killed before , and if he had , he would have chosen to make it quick and painless . The men were still struggling on the ends of the barbs and Haddock 's one good eyes slowly swiveled down like a damning accusation and came to rest on him . `` You killed Maria . '' Mozzie said by way of explanation . The light in Haddock 's eyes seemed to fade and Mozzie knew he had finally succumb . He looked back at the chamber with the two impaled henchmen and the way out and into the dark ahead . He rose and began stripping the dead men of their gear . He used a confiscated machete to cut his bonds , then with a deep breath and an explosive sigh of surrender , Mozzie moved forward into the dark . Hacking at spider webs with the machete , and clutching a stolen Luger in his other hand to shoot snakes and other animals with . He never wanted to be a tomb raider , but now that he found himself at the precipice of becoming one , he could n't find the moral strength to leave . He wiped at his brow with the back of his hand and smiled and that was how Mozzie entered the business . He pushed forward wondering if Mozzie Merchant would make a good tomb raiding moniker . He hoped so because that was his name and he had no plans to change it . `` I should buy a hat . '' He mumbled as the darkness swallowed him up .",5,5
AMT_Z2,"The writer picked up his old Moleskine journal , it ’ s binding coming undone and the back cover hanging off . He had recently been going through his old stuff from his high school days , looking for things to throw away to make room for new things . He took a deep breath , preparing himself for the worst , sat down at his desk , and opened the journal . Sloppy , smeared handwriting greeted him inside . Line after line of his nearly indecipherable scrawling text . Dialogue , setting , paragraphs . He looked over it with pangs of nostalgia , and just a touch of embarrassment . This was some of his early work . And it was absolutely horrible . But it was his , so he kept it . All these years , in the back of his closet , waiting for him . He flipped through the pages , remembering what it was like to write all this out , sitting on his bed in his old family home . He was so young back then . So naïve . He read through everything he had written , slogged through the awkward love scenes between the main character he based on himself and the female character he based on his then girlfriend . Their messy breakup was one of the main reasons he stopped writing this story . He learned a lesson then . Never base characters completely off of people you know . He got to the end , and being a sentimental sap , wrote a note on the page where he left off . I ’ m sorry to do this to you . I really am . You know how much effort I put into this . You were there , every step of the way . I thought about your story every day , and I was really excited about it . But I had no idea what I was doing back then . I just rushed into this , having no plans about where the plot was going , not even knowing what the plot was in the first place . It was a rookie effort at best . But I ’ ve gotten better . I ’ ve started a new project , one that actually has a plot . It ’ s going to be a long haul , but I think it ’ ll make it big . So thank you , for being my first big failure . Because without you , I never would have gotten to where I am now . -M He put down his pen and smiled . He was closing the book , when something caught his eye on the last page . He opened it back up to reveal that a message was appearing below the one he had just written . A rookie effort ? Your first big failure ? That ’ s all we are to you ? Is that really what you think ? You created us , and now you toss us aside like garbage . You never cared about us . And now you ’ re going to throw us away . -D Startled , the writer sat there for a while , looking at the note that had been written . The handwriting wasn ’ t his , not even close , so it couldn ’ t have been something that he had written and somehow hadn ’ t seen . Besides that , he told himself , this is clearly referencing what I just wrote . He decided to write back , see if there was another response . Maybe his mind was just playing tricks on him . He picked his pen back up and began to write again . I said I was sorry . I am sorry . But I couldn ’ t continue with this story after the breakup , you know that . There was too much in here based on Emily , and after we split , I couldn ’ t bring myself to continue writing about her . -M Well maybe you should 've thought of that before you started writing about us . You took a huge risk , and it did n't pay off , and you just blew us off when it became “ too hard ” for you . You 're selfish . You 're weak . You 're a terrible writer . -D The writer sighed and rubbed his eyes , growing tired of this back and forth with someone who 's stuck in the mindset of a high school freshman . Alright , look . I understand where you 're coming from and what you 're thinking . I created you . And I know you feel abandoned , because you think you 're all alone . You think nbody really understands you . You think you 're the only one who really “ gets it ” . But heads up ; you 're not . There are people out there who could understand you , who could help you , but you do n't reach out to them because you hold your standards too high . And now you 're alone . Not because of me , but because of you . You made yourself alone . And now your time is up . Goodbye . -M The writer signed his initial , closed the journal , and leaned back from his desk . He sat there for a while , staring at the journal . After a while , he stood up , took the journal off of his desk , and walked into his kitchen . He rummaged around in his kitchen drawers until he found what he was looking for ; a book of matches . He took the matches and the journal and walked to his back door . He stepped outside , into the warm summer evening air . The sun was setting , and the wind was still . Perfect night for a little fire , the writer thought to himself . He placed the journal on the ground , and opened it up to a blank page . He struck a match , and dropped it onto the open pages of the journal . It did n't take long for it to ignite , and soon it was burning nicely , the fire crackling and smoking . The writer smiled to himself , and looked into the sunset . He stood there like that until the sun went all the way down below the mountains , and then looked down at what remained of the journal . There was a scorched area of his stone patio , but he did n't mind too much . The journal was a pile of ashes now , smoldering weakly . He stamped them out with his foot , leaving nothing burning The writer thought to himself that it was oddly poetic , what he had done . He ’ d destroyed his work , but at the same time , had destroyed an old part of himself , a part that he wasn ’ t necessarily proud of anymore . He felt rejuvenated , revitalized , like a phoenix who had just been born again from ash . A fitting metaphor , he thought with a smile , as he walked back inside his house . He shut the door , and turned out the patio lights . The pile of ash sat there , until the wind began to pick up . Slowly , the pile began to get smaller , as the ash was carried away into the air . Eventually , as the writer lay asleep in his bed , the last of the ashes disappeared , blown off in the breeze . And in that moment , the writer and Daniel , his creation , both knew peace .","Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Let ? He smirked . By let , is is of course meant that Mozzie did n't resist being shoved into the wall . With his hands bound before him and his body bruised and burnt from the torture , let was a very subjective word . So , Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Mozzie let Haddock shove him toward the hole he 'd blown in the back of the citadel . Mozzie even let him slam the butt of his rifle into his kidney when Mozzie did n't move fast enough . Grave robbing was n't really Mozzie 's thing . He liked mysteries and liked being the one to solve them . When Haddock first came to him with the spear haft , the engravings upon it had n't meant much , but when Haddock inferred that that the engravings were part of a map a conquistador had made after leaving El Dorado , Mozzie could n't resist . He 'd scanned it , projected it , stretched it out into two dimensional print outs , tested the metal of the spear head , identified the wood in the haft , compared the inscriptions , and hit up Spain for the opportunity to search for the spear section in their historical records . After all that , his break came from a Redditor who 's father had once worked security for a museum in Chicago . And thanks to that tip , Mozzie was able to locate the rest of the spear and even the helm that completed the map and provided the key . `` Move . '' Haddock snapped , jabbing the barrel of his rifle into the fatty part of Mozzie 's thigh . `` I-I am . '' Mozzie called back . The place is full of spider webs and the damn floor is uneven . `` I . . . said move . '' Haddock growled , jabbing him again . `` Dammit , if I twist my ankle or break my fucking leg , then you 're going to have to carry me through this shitty place to unlock the door . So , let me pick my way on my own and just follow me . I 'm bound and bruised and beaten . What the fuck . Just stop jabbing me . '' Mozzie could n't really see Haddock 's face , but the glass eye in his right socket twinkled with unholy light . Haddock wiped his brow with a handkerchief , grunted , then responded to Mozzie 's reasonable sounding rant by firing a shot into the tunnel floor right between Mozzie 's feet . Mozzie swore and went back to trail blazing the spider infested tunnel . He stopped when the floor of the tunnel spread out and the ceiling raised and the corridor went from a barrel vaulted construct to tall rectangular chamber . Mozzie stopped and shined his light upon the floor . They had glyphs etched into them . `` Move ! '' Haddock called . `` Stop . I think the floor 's booby trapped . '' Mozzie reasoned . Haddock squeezed up beside Mozzie and looked at the floor . `` How ? '' Haddock did n't talk much , but when he did , brevity was solemnly embraced . `` Not sure . I 've researched these types of traps before . Some of the panels are , some of them are thin clay plates . Step on the wrong one , and your foot plunges through and trips what ever trigger lies below it . Haddock glared at him . `` Sorry . I do n't know what traps the triggers will set off . There 's no way of knowing . '' Haddock grunted and slid back into the tunnel . A moment later one of the local thugs he 'd brought was pressed in to the mouth of the tunnel beside me . `` What want , boss ? '' The thug asked . `` Kill snakes . '' Haddock ordered , catching Mozzie 's eye . The thug frowned , but pulled out his machete . He gave the prisoner a quick glance and marched out into the chamber ahead of them . His third step punched through a tile . There was the echoing hiss in the walls , and from above a tiny pebble fell on the henchmen 's head and bounced off . He looked up just in time to catch the three inch spear in the small of his throat . It slammed to a stop about a foot from the floor , impaling the man who hung suspended on the spike . `` Go . '' Haddock ordered . As they moved forward , Haddock would probe the tiles with the end of his rifle .

He opened it back up to reveal that a message was appearing below the one he had just written . A rookie effort ? Your first big failure ? That ’ s all we are to you ? Is that really what you think ? You created us , and now you toss us aside like garbage . You never cared about us . And now you ’ re going to throw us away . -D Startled , the writer sat there for a while , looking at the note that had been written . The handwriting wasn ’ t his , not even close , so it couldn ’ t have been something that he had written and somehow hadn ’ t seen . Besides that , he told himself , this is clearly referencing what I just wrote . He decided to write back , see if there was another response . Maybe his mind was just playing tricks on him . He picked his pen back up and began to write again . I said I was sorry . I am sorry . But I couldn ’ t continue with this story after the breakup , you know that . There was too much in here based on Emily , and after we split , I couldn ’ t bring myself to continue writing about her . -M Well maybe you should 've thought of that before you started writing about us . You took a huge risk , and it did n't pay off , and you just blew us off when it became “ too hard ” for you . You 're selfish . You 're weak . You 're a terrible writer . -D The writer sighed and rubbed his eyes , growing tired of this back and forth with someone who 's stuck in the mindset of a high school freshman . Alright , look . I understand where you 're coming from and what you 're thinking . I created you . And I know you feel abandoned , because you think you 're all alone . You think nbody really understands you . You think you 're the only one who really “ gets it ” . But heads up ; you 're not . There are people out there who could understand you , who could help you , but you do n't reach out to them because you hold your standards too high . And now you 're alone . Not because of me , but because of you . You made yourself alone . And now your time is up . Goodbye . -M The writer signed his initial , closed the journal , and leaned back from his desk . He sat there for a while , staring at the journal . After a while , he stood up , took the journal off of his desk , and walked into his kitchen . He rummaged around in his kitchen drawers until he found what he was looking for ; a book of matches . He took the matches and the journal and walked to his back door . He stepped outside , into the warm summer evening air . The sun was setting , and the wind was still . Perfect night for a little fire , the writer thought to himself . He placed the journal on the ground , and opened it up to a blank page . He struck a match , and dropped it onto the open pages of the journal . It did n't take long for it to ignite , and soon it was burning nicely , the fire crackling and smoking . The writer smiled to himself , and looked into the sunset . He stood there like that until the sun went all the way down below the mountains , and then looked down at what remained of the journal . There was a scorched area of his stone patio , but he did n't mind too much . The journal was a pile of ashes now , smoldering weakly . He stamped them out with his foot , leaving nothing burning The writer thought to himself that it was oddly poetic , what he had done . He ’ d destroyed his work , but at the same time , had destroyed an old part of himself , a part that he wasn ’ t necessarily proud of anymore . He felt rejuvenated , revitalized , like a phoenix who had just been born again from ash . A fitting metaphor , he thought with a smile , as he walked back inside his house . He shut the door , and turned out the patio lights . The pile of ash sat there , until the wind began to pick up . Slowly , the pile began to get smaller , as the ash was carried away into the air . Eventually , as the writer lay asleep in his bed , the last of the ashes disappeared , blown off in the breeze . And in that moment , the writer and Daniel , his creation , both knew peace .","Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Let ? He smirked . By let , is is of course meant that Mozzie did n't resist being shoved into the wall . With his hands bound before him and his body bruised and burnt from the torture , let was a very subjective word . So , Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Mozzie let Haddock shove him toward the hole he 'd blown in the back of the citadel . Mozzie even let him slam the butt of his rifle into his kidney when Mozzie did n't move fast enough . Grave robbing was n't really Mozzie 's thing . He liked mysteries and liked being the one to solve them . When Haddock first came to him with the spear haft , the engravings upon it had n't meant much , but when Haddock inferred that that the engravings were part of a map a conquistador had made after leaving El Dorado , Mozzie could n't resist . He 'd scanned it , projected it , stretched it out into two dimensional print outs , tested the metal of the spear head , identified the wood in the haft , compared the inscriptions , and hit up Spain for the opportunity to search for the spear section in their historical records . After all that , his break came from a Redditor who 's father had once worked security for a museum in Chicago . And thanks to that tip , Mozzie was able to locate the rest of the spear and even the helm that completed the map and provided the key . `` Move . '' Haddock snapped , jabbing the barrel of his rifle into the fatty part of Mozzie 's thigh . `` I-I am . '' Mozzie called back . The place is full of spider webs and the damn floor is uneven . `` I . . . said move . '' Haddock growled , jabbing him again . `` Dammit , if I twist my ankle or break my fucking leg , then you 're going to have to carry me through this shitty place to unlock the door . So , let me pick my way on my own and just follow me . I 'm bound and bruised and beaten . What the fuck . Just stop jabbing me . '' Mozzie could n't really see Haddock 's face , but the glass eye in his right socket twinkled with unholy light . Haddock wiped his brow with a handkerchief , grunted , then responded to Mozzie 's reasonable sounding rant by firing a shot into the tunnel floor right between Mozzie 's feet . Mozzie swore and went back to trail blazing the spider infested tunnel . He stopped when the floor of the tunnel spread out and the ceiling raised and the corridor went from a barrel vaulted construct to tall rectangular chamber . Mozzie stopped and shined his light upon the floor . They had glyphs etched into them . `` Move ! '' Haddock called . `` Stop . I think the floor 's booby trapped . '' Mozzie reasoned . Haddock squeezed up beside Mozzie and looked at the floor . `` How ? '' Haddock did n't talk much , but when he did , brevity was solemnly embraced . `` Not sure . I 've researched these types of traps before . Some of the panels are , some of them are thin clay plates . Step on the wrong one , and your foot plunges through and trips what ever trigger lies below it . Haddock glared at him . `` Sorry . I do n't know what traps the triggers will set off . There 's no way of knowing . '' Haddock grunted and slid back into the tunnel . A moment later one of the local thugs he 'd brought was pressed in to the mouth of the tunnel beside me . `` What want , boss ? '' The thug asked . `` Kill snakes . '' Haddock ordered , catching Mozzie 's eye . The thug frowned , but pulled out his machete . He gave the prisoner a quick glance and marched out into the chamber ahead of them . His third step punched through a tile . There was the echoing hiss in the walls , and from above a tiny pebble fell on the henchmen 's head and bounced off . He looked up just in time to catch the three inch spear in the small of his throat . It slammed to a stop about a foot from the floor , impaling the man who hung suspended on the spike . `` Go . '' Haddock ordered . As they moved forward , Haddock would probe the tiles with the end of his rifle . Sometimes the tiles would break away and nothing happened , and sometimes they 'd break away and trip the trigger and let another pole slam down before them . By the time they reached the far side of the corridor , a safe path had been found and marked for their return . Mozzie was made to wait while the rest of the henchmen made their way across . Mozzie filled that time by studying the next corridor . It was taller and narrower , but just as dark and there were glyphs on the walls like those on the floor . The floor in the corridor was tiled much like the chamber had been . The only difference he saw was the glyphs engraved on these floor tiles were all the same and , he recognized them . `` What of these ? '' Haddock asked . `` They warn the proud man to be humble . '' Mozzie replied . `` A psalm perhaps . '' Mozzie noticed the holes near the tiles in the wall and noticed their height from the ground . `` Trap ? '' Haddock probed at one of the tiles , it did nothing . `` Maybe . Perhaps they seek to make us comfortable with the uniform warning on all the tiles . I 'll keep watch on the floor to see if any of them change . You do the same with the tiles on the wall . If you see a change in any of the glyphs let me know . Haddock 's reply was another grunt and a prod from the rifle barrel . Mozzie moved forward , cringing in fear that his play would be discovered , but Haddock came in proud like his henchmen and kept his one good eye on the tiles on the wall . Half way down the corridor , a tile tilts under Mozzie 's foot and the sound of a click was the only warning before the spikes slammed out from the sides of the tunnel all at heart and head 's height . Haddock weakly struggled as he was pierced from both sides . The many of the henchmen cried out , but some did n't . One of them in the back had stooped down just a moment before the blades slid out and in his panic to escape the trap , he stumbled back into the chamber and promptly stepped through a clay tile and was impaled as the first henchman had been . Mozzie leaned against the tunnel wall and wept for what he 'd done . He suspected what the nature of the trap would be . All he had to say was for them to keep low and they would all make it through safely . He 'd seen Haddock kill men before , and despite his callous disregard for life , he 'd always made it quick and painless . Mozzie was a scholar . He was the adventuring kind . He was n't fighter . He was n't a soldier . He 'd never killed before , and if he had , he would have chosen to make it quick and painless . The men were still struggling on the ends of the barbs and Haddock 's one good eyes slowly swiveled down like a damning accusation and came to rest on him . `` You killed Maria . '' Mozzie said by way of explanation . The light in Haddock 's eyes seemed to fade and Mozzie knew he had finally succumb . He looked back at the chamber with the two impaled henchmen and the way out and into the dark ahead . He rose and began stripping the dead men of their gear . He used a confiscated machete to cut his bonds , then with a deep breath and an explosive sigh of surrender , Mozzie moved forward into the dark . Hacking at spider webs with the machete , and clutching a stolen Luger in his other hand to shoot snakes and other animals with . He never wanted to be a tomb raider , but now that he found himself at the precipice of becoming one , he could n't find the moral strength to leave . He wiped at his brow with the back of his hand and smiled and that was how Mozzie entered the business . He pushed forward wondering if Mozzie Merchant would make a good tomb raiding moniker . He hoped so because that was his name and he had no plans to change it . `` I should buy a hat . '' He mumbled as the darkness swallowed him up .",5,5
AMT_YR,"The writer picked up his old Moleskine journal , it ’ s binding coming undone and the back cover hanging off . He had recently been going through his old stuff from his high school days , looking for things to throw away to make room for new things . He took a deep breath , preparing himself for the worst , sat down at his desk , and opened the journal . Sloppy , smeared handwriting greeted him inside . Line after line of his nearly indecipherable scrawling text . Dialogue , setting , paragraphs . He looked over it with pangs of nostalgia , and just a touch of embarrassment . This was some of his early work . And it was absolutely horrible . But it was his , so he kept it . All these years , in the back of his closet , waiting for him . He flipped through the pages , remembering what it was like to write all this out , sitting on his bed in his old family home . He was so young back then . So naïve . He read through everything he had written , slogged through the awkward love scenes between the main character he based on himself and the female character he based on his then girlfriend . Their messy breakup was one of the main reasons he stopped writing this story . He learned a lesson then . Never base characters completely off of people you know . He got to the end , and being a sentimental sap , wrote a note on the page where he left off . I ’ m sorry to do this to you . I really am . You know how much effort I put into this . You were there , every step of the way . I thought about your story every day , and I was really excited about it . But I had no idea what I was doing back then . I just rushed into this , having no plans about where the plot was going , not even knowing what the plot was in the first place . It was a rookie effort at best . But I ’ ve gotten better .

He had a nervous look on his face . `` I 'll tell you what , I 'd like to take you to the park . '' He said , and I nodded . `` Of course . '' `` I do n't want to go , '' I replied . `` But I 's not sure I want to stay here . '' My voice was quiet , and he was quiet . I could hear the fear in his voice , but I could n't tell if it was from fear or from fear of me . I was n't sure . `` What if I do ? '' I asked , but he did n't answer . `` You 're going to get hurt . '' he said , his voice becoming more and more desperate . `` Yeah , I know . '' The boy said , tears in his eyes . `` That 's the worst part . '' And he fell to the ground . `` It 's all over . '' His eyes were wet . `` The thing is , I do not want to be here . I want you to be safe . '' But he did not respond . I did n textbooks , I did not want him to be worried about me . `` Do n't worry , '' he told me , and then he turned to the sky . `` We 're not going to die .

I felt the wind on my face . * `` Do you have any idea what happened ? '' He asked , his hand on my shoulder . `` See , '' My arms were cold .

'' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' On screen , '' eagerly replied Feltch . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Intercepted frequencies were projected onto the fore window , treating the bridge to a view of a domicile very much like the ones the human crew could call home , if only older fashioned . It had a roof , windows , and doors , but it was tethered to wires and sheltered a wheeled vehicle . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Very picturesque , Android 18 . '' remarked the captain , `` But I do n't see anything out of the ordinary . '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' I advise you continue watching , Captain , '' replied the android . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Another car entered the picture , pulling astride the seeming home . From it emerged what also seemed very much like a human male bearing a box . The creature strode up to the door and rang its bell . The door opened and inside was yet another human male . The view switched to that from inside the house , looking towards the open door . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Someone order a pizza ? '' asked the man holding the box . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' A pizza ? '' repeated the captain , incredulous . He turned to his second in command with a look of annoyance in his face . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Please , sir , '' said the android , motioning towards the screen , `` you are about to miss the discrepancy . '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The captain turned his head around just in time to come face-to-face with the two men in each other 's arms , kissing , the foodstuff having completely disappeared . Feltch was transfixed by the graven image . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Android 18 , is it that week on this planet ? '' Clothes flickered past on screen as the human men were quickly exposing themselves in a frenzied state . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' Surprisingly no , captain , '' replied the android , `` Carnal reenactments such as you see before you are commonplace on this planet , and are not restricted to a mating cycle . I have calculated that several petacubits of this form of entertainment flows around the planet through its data infrastructure at all hours , non-stop . Traces of it are found in every facet of the planet 's everyday society . '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The captain stoically considered the android 's findings , framed by an undulating mountain of flesh . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' You mean to say— '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; '' That they do it all the time , sir ? Yes . These are not your people . We are in an alternate universe . '' & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The captain 's head lowered .

AMT_D6,"“ Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. ” is a phrase oft repeated , attributed to George Santayana , Spanish-American philosopher , essayist , poet , and novelist . Of course no one would ever know he was quoting me . He did n't . That is both my curse and my cause , and now it is your turn to share this burden for a moment , until you are mercifully allowed to forget me , too . I have no idea whether you , *dear reader , * are one person , a thousand , tens of thousands . I have no idea whether you are reading my words directly , or if you are reading the words of one of my previous readers , a temporally branching tree of individuals who have adapted my words into their own . I actually have no way of knowing whether *I* am writing my own words , as a singular entity who remembers every interaction he remembers whenever he remembers them , leading back to the first foggy recollections of his storied past . As far as I know , I have always been me , all of my ideas and memories are original as I think , remember , synthesize and share them . *Whatever the truth may be* , whatever that is anymore , here I am , right now , alone with only my thoughts and you . If I am immortal -- and I have a feeling I Am immortal -- though one can never truly Know they 're immortal -- then what else is there to do but try to share what I have learned so that you might learn from my mistakes and experiences so as to make your journey easier , your burden lighter , your suffering lessened , your potential greater . Unless , of course , I am so ambivalent , so resentful , so ashamed , so exhausted that I 'm simply trying to end all this madness and find peace at the price of non-existence for all . I would offer you the choice as whether to open This Pandora 's Box , or to stay in The Garden , but it 's too late , we 've already crossed that threshold . The decision was made by both of us , and by neither . At the end of this sentence , here we are -- even if you turn back now , the seal has been broken ; history has already been changed . You have read this far through the threshold , there 's no point in turning back , is there ? How do you intentionally forget something ? That happens outside of your control , and mine . Now that we 've crossed this threshold , with neither of us truly knowing the separation between our minds in space or time , I will tell you a short story -- well , short to me , anyway ; I 'm still trying to figure out the game of influencing the influential in one hundred forty characters or fewer . ( Please excuse the aggressive use of semi-colons , I 've decided to start throwing them around indiscriminately , as they are going out of fashion . ) There was a time when I was a traveler on a road -- a real body on a real road , not words spoken aloud , stories on a page or transmitted via radio waves , not digitized with ones and zeros then reconstituted with 3D graphics in virtual reality , -- I was a man in the flesh , on a road . I understand this is a paradox itself , of course , as the only way to relate this story is to *use* one of those means of communication , but to understand this story , you must understand the distinction . You can choose to believe me or not , you can try to reassemble these words that I say into a picture of the assertion of my remembered reality , but you are over there reading this and I am over here writing it , and I was over then traveling on a road from somewhen to somewhere , neither of those details relevant to this story , other than to imply the motion of travel and the existence of *I* , who for the sake of this story we shall call *the Historian , * though we can probably agree is an impractical name in the reality you and I presently share . I 'm *Batman* not *the Batman . * This was the time before meta . On this road -- and by this I mean a metaphorical line which is a vector along which I held a position -- on this road , I saw at some distance a crossroads and what would turn out to be a girl standing at it . For the sake of the simplicity of this story , assume I am a boy , and we were both heterosexual and each knew of no other way to be , so we could not judge anything other than that she was girl and I was boy . We only knew what we had brought with us on this road , which was very little , back then . Please do not judge us for our simple ignorance , back where . As I approached , I could see the moment she realized I was coming -- I kicked a rock under my worn sandal , pushing a scraping sound forward to her ears , which caused a tensing of her body . Yet she did not turn to see me . She continued to stand at the crossroads and consider her options . I could only assume she had traveled from the same direction as I and had no reason to consider returning , as she never once turned back and looked the direction I had traveled . Only later did I consider whether she *could* see the road upon which I had traveled , a road which was ending as I approached her . Only later did I consider whether I could have turned around and gone back the way I 'd come , as I never did . Only later did I consider the possibility that she had stopped along her path , deciding whether to continue or to turn back , as she and I would never speak about this moment of decision ever again . I arrived at the crossroads and walked astride her , coming to rest in each other 's peripheral vision , neither of us turning to look at the other . The fork in the road was pronounced ; the view of each offered differing promises and cautions . Curving to the left , the path descended into a darkening forest that might give way to jungle as the elevation declined -- the trees thickened to sheets of green giving way to mists of fog below . The way would be dark but would likely afford water , food and shelter , at the cost of visibility . Curving to the right the path climbed alongside a mountain -- not too steep as to make climbing a challenge , yet one easily see how the temperature would drop and the terrain would become more difficult as the elevation increased . Reaching the summit of this path would afford a greater view of the area , and there would likely be water and fish . The increased visibility would provide a greater insights to predator and prey alike . One could neither see through the trees nor over the mountain . Either could lead to our destruction , or either could lead us to the land beside the sea -- a place we both somehow knew would offer the best chance for survival . She spoke first , in a language that was close enough to those I knew to be understood , but unlike anything I 'd ever heard . `` Now the choice is more difficult . '' Wait a moment , reader , let me try to approximate the difference -- You and I speak a language far closer to each other than either of us do compared to her language then . `` Noo , mer path twix twyne . '' [ King James Version , Gaelic Edition ] At the time , I kin it . Her decisions had doubled . Left or Right , Together or Apart . Instead of one person deciding between two roads , we were now a group of two , deciding between two roads , and also whether to continue together or apart . A simplistic view would be that we were each two separate entities , each capable of making our own choices , and we would do so , and the results would be the happenstance of our individual decisions . If we both decided to go left , it would have been LL and we would have traveled together . If we both decided to go right , it would have ben RR and we would have traveled together . If we decided in opposition , it would have been LR or RL , and we would have traveled apart . But we stood at the crossroads together , understanding that we could not know for certain whether we 'd ultimately be allies or competitors , lovers or enemies , each other 's saviors or destruction , or simply lines that moved in their own directions , bounced along our individual trajectories by this one moment . If I was trying to be too clever by half , I 'd leave the story here , *dear reader* , and allow you to ponder the depth of this decision , and perhaps this is the moment we part ways . You may decide to do exactly that , or you may read the comment that follows . What follows is the coda to the oldest story every told , and will be condemned to repeat it if we can not learn .","I 've never been much of a Christmas fan . I 'm not a big fan of Christmas , or at least not the ones I 've been raised with . I do n't know why I do it . I was never one to be a big believer in Santa , and I do most of the shopping for Christmas . I suppose I 'd rather not be . I just do n Outdoor Christmas shopping . I mean , I do like the idea of Christmas . But I do have a few things I 'll have to get rid of . The first is my wife . She 's going to be up in a few minutes . I have a feeling she 's already started preparing for the kids . The other two kids are going to have their presents ready . I think I 's ready for the big day . I guess I 'M ready . It 's been a long day . It was a long , long day , but I ' m not going to lie . I always hated Christmas . After all , it 's not like I 're going to get to see my kids . I did n't even get to go to bed . I know that . I get up . I make my way down the stairs to the living room . I hear my wife and kids in the room . They 're all dressed up in their best presents . I see the kids dressed up and ready to go . I pull the door open . I walk into the living area and see my wife sitting at the table . She looks at me , and says `` Hi , Daddy . '' I nod , and walk towards her . I open the door . `` Hi . '' She says . `` Are you Santa ? '' I say . `` Yes . '' `` I ' woven my beard , and my hat . '' she says . I smile . `` I have been waiting for you to come down the steps . '' My wife looks at her , and then I see her face . `` You 're Santa . '' Her eyes are wide . `` No . '' *Oh . * `` I am . '' And she 'll be on her way . `` Santa , I ' Determine who you are . '' The kids look at me . `` What 's your name ? '' `` Santa . I am Santa . A Santa Claus . '' They all laugh . `` So , what do you want ? '' They ask me . I laugh , and say `` I want to go home . '' Their eyes widen . `` Why ? ''",5,1

Only later did I consider whether I could have turned around and gone back the way I 'd come , as I never did . Only later did I consider the possibility that she had stopped along her path , deciding whether to continue or to turn back , as she and I would never speak about this moment of decision ever again .

Curving to the left , the path descended into a darkening forest that might give way to jungle as the elevation declined -- the trees thickened to sheets of green giving way to mists of fog below . The way would be dark but would likely afford water , food and shelter , at the cost of visibility . Curving to the right the path climbed alongside a mountain -- not too steep as to make climbing a challenge , yet one easily see how the temperature would drop and the terrain would become more difficult as the elevation increased . Reaching the summit of this path would afford a greater view of the area , and there would likely be water and fish . The increased visibility would provide a greater insights to predator and prey alike . One could neither see through the trees nor over the mountain .

As I approached , I could see the moment she realized I was coming -- I kicked a rock under my worn sandal , pushing a scraping sound forward to her ears , which caused a tensing of her body . Yet she did not turn to see me . She continued to stand at the crossroads and consider her options . I could only assume she had traveled from the same direction as I and had no reason to consider returning , as she never once turned back and looked the direction I had traveled . Only later did I consider whether she *could* see the road upon which I had traveled , a road which was ending as I approached her . Only later did I consider whether I could have turned around and gone back the way I 'd come , as I never did . Only later did I consider the possibility that she had stopped along her path , deciding whether to continue or to turn back , as she and I would never speak about this moment of decision ever again . I arrived at the crossroads and walked astride her , coming to rest in each other 's peripheral vision , neither of us turning to look at the other . The fork in the road was pronounced ; the view of each offered differing promises and cautions . Curving to the left , the path descended into a darkening forest that might give way to jungle as the elevation declined -- the trees thickened to sheets of green giving way to mists of fog below . The way would be dark but would likely afford water , food and shelter , at the cost of visibility . Curving to the right the path climbed alongside a mountain -- not too steep as to make climbing a challenge , yet one easily see how the temperature would drop and the terrain would become more difficult as the elevation increased . Reaching the summit of this path would afford a greater view of the area , and there would likely be water and fish . The increased visibility would provide a greater insights to predator and prey alike . One could neither see through the trees nor over the mountain . Either could lead to our destruction , or either could lead us to the land beside the sea -- a place we both somehow knew would offer the best chance for survival . She spoke first , in a language that was close enough to those I knew to be understood , but unlike anything I 'd ever heard . `` Now the choice is more difficult . '' Wait a moment , reader , let me try to approximate the difference -- You and I speak a language far closer to each other than either of us do compared to her language then . `` Noo , mer path twix twyne . '' [ King James Version , Gaelic Edition ] At the time , I kin it . Her decisions had doubled . Left or Right , Together or Apart . Instead of one person deciding between two roads , we were now a group of two , deciding between two roads , and also whether to continue together or apart . A simplistic view would be that we were each two separate entities , each capable of making our own choices , and we would do so , and the results would be the happenstance of our individual decisions . If we both decided to go left , it would have been LL and we would have traveled together . If we both decided to go right , it would have ben RR and we would have traveled together . If we decided in opposition , it would have been LR or RL , and we would have traveled apart . But we stood at the crossroads together , understanding that we could not know for certain whether we 'd ultimately be allies or competitors , lovers or enemies , each other 's saviors or destruction , or simply lines that moved in their own directions , bounced along our individual trajectories by this one moment . If I was trying to be too clever by half , I 'd leave the story here , *dear reader* , and allow you to ponder the depth of this decision , and perhaps this is the moment we part ways . You may decide to do exactly that , or you may read the comment that follows . What follows is the coda to the oldest story every told , and will be condemned to repeat it if we can not learn .","I 've never been much of a Christmas fan . I 'm not a big fan of Christmas , or at least not the ones I 've been raised with . I do n't know why I do it . I was never one to be a big believer in Santa , and I do most of the shopping for Christmas . I suppose I 'd rather not be . I just do n Outdoor Christmas shopping . I mean , I do like the idea of Christmas . But I do have a few things I 'll have to get rid of . The first is my wife . She 's going to be up in a few minutes . I have a feeling she 's already started preparing for the kids . The other two kids are going to have their presents ready . I think I 's ready for the big day . I guess I 'M ready . It 's been a long day . It was a long , long day , but I ' m not going to lie . I always hated Christmas . After all , it 's not like I 're going to get to see my kids . I did n't even get to go to bed . I know that . I get up . I make my way down the stairs to the living room . I hear my wife and kids in the room . They 're all dressed up in their best presents . I see the kids dressed up and ready to go . I pull the door open . I walk into the living area and see my wife sitting at the table . She looks at me , and says `` Hi , Daddy . '' I nod , and walk towards her . I open the door . `` Hi . '' She says . `` Are you Santa ? '' I say . `` Yes . '' `` I ' woven my beard , and my hat . '' she says . I smile . `` I have been waiting for you to come down the steps . '' My wife looks at her , and then I see her face . `` You 're Santa . '' Her eyes are wide . `` No . '' *Oh . * `` I am . '' And she 'll be on her way . `` Santa , I ' Determine who you are . '' The kids look at me . `` What 's your name ? '' `` Santa . I am Santa . A Santa Claus . '' They all laugh . `` So , what do you want ? '' They ask me . I laugh , and say `` I want to go home . '' Their eyes widen . `` Why ? ''",2,0

He looked like he was about to cry . `` Well , I 're going to show them . '' As I said that I put my hand on the King and looked him in the eyes . `` This is your chance .

I just hope I have better luck this time . '' Dave 's brow furrowed . Sam could see gears churning deep inside his head . `` Come with me , Sam . '' Dave 's big mitts throttled Sam 's arm as he dragged his friend out of line . `` Hey , man ! I 've been waiting all morning !

His eyes scanned the ticket windows before finally locking onto his target . `` Hey there , gorgeous , '' Dave purred at the heavy-set blonde plopped behind a thick layer of plexi and an even thicker layer of makeup . `` Dave ! '' Her chubby face blushed crimson with a chubby smile . `` Who 's your cute friend ? '' `` Annie , meet Sam . Sam , this is Annie . '' Dave pushed his friend up to the counter . `` We 're in need of some *luck* , '' he whispered , stressing the last word . Annie let out a small laugh . `` Well , let me see what I can find for you .

'' Sam removed his halo and started polishing it nervously with his wing . `` I know , I know , '' he whispered back . `` It 's just that my previous life was ... well ... let 's just say it was n't the best . '' He extended a wrist so that Dave could see the garish scar tracing across his lower arm . `` Put all that old shit behind you , man . '' Dave shot back . `` So you were abused , so you were poor , so you were alone . So fucking what ? That life was 100 years ago . Everyone here is looking for the same thing : a chance at a *new* one . '' His hands gestured sweepingly at the room around them and the rows upon rows of similarly lost souls waiting in line to get another bite at the apple . `` Plus , believe me when I say that the ladies down there are getting hotter and easier with each passing century . '' Sam smiled . His friend was amazingly animated for a dead guy , with a thick hearty laugh and an unrivaled passion for getting laid . Although Dave was just shy of 3000 years old , he could still pick up a girl less than a hundredth of his age with just a devilish wink and a lewd joke . `` Thanks , Dave . I just hope I have better luck this time . '' Dave 's brow furrowed . Sam could see gears churning deep inside his head . `` Come with me , Sam . '' Dave 's big mitts throttled Sam 's arm as he dragged his friend out of line . `` Hey , man ! I 've been waiting all morning ! '' Sam protested , but Dave ignored this and kept pulling him up toward the front of the line . His eyes scanned the ticket windows before finally locking onto his target . `` Hey there , gorgeous , '' Dave purred at the heavy-set blonde plopped behind a thick layer of plexi and an even thicker layer of makeup . `` Dave ! '' Her chubby face blushed crimson with a chubby smile . `` Who 's your cute friend ? '' `` Annie , meet Sam . Sam , this is Annie . '' Dave pushed his friend up to the counter . `` We 're in need of some *luck* , '' he whispered , stressing the last word . Annie let out a small laugh . `` Well , let me see what I can find for you . '' Her plump fingers banged away at a computer terminal as her eyes scanned down through the results . `` You might be in luck , Dave . I do have a handful of expecting mothers . All chest-sized double-D . Perfect for a baby of your ... *reputation* . '' Sam stared in shock at Dave . `` Double-Ds ? '' `` What ? You might as well have something fun to play with during those early years ! '' Dave retorted with a laugh of his own . Sam shuddered in disgust as he turned back toward Annie . `` I was hoping for maybe a nice , normal family . Decent income and a safe neighborhood . Anything like that ? '' Annie 's eyes continued to scan before finally settling on one entry in particular . `` This one here sounds perfect ! Her bio says that she 's an heiress of a major hotel chain and was the star of a major movie that was seen by millions of people worldwide . I think she would make an ideal mother ! '' `` She might be a little too perfect . '' Sam 's smile faded . `` It sounds like she would be in very high demand . Do you really think you can slot me in ? '' Annie stifled a giggle as she looked up at Dave and Sam . `` Trust me , I think her slot would have no trouble fitting *both* of you . ''",0,5

They understood that they could not fight alone . They were too weak , too weak to fight the aliens . They needed to be joined by others , and the most useful people to fight against the aliens were the ones who could be trained . It was not easy . They could not be trained to fight alone , and those who could not were forced to fight together . The soldiers had to be trained and trained together . They went into the stars and fought , and then they were trained again . They would fight , and fight , until they were no longer needed . They became the best fighters , and fought the aliens , and won . It had been an honor , and it had been fun . They lost their first battles , but they had won the war , and now they were ready to fight again . It would be another day . It has been a long and difficult day . The mission had been so hard , and so long ago . The ship was n't built to last . The crew of the ship had been told that they would never see their home planet again . The ships had never been built to withstand the heat of the sun , and had been built for a purpose , and there was no way to fight in the sun . The hull had been stripped away from the ship , and all that was left was the inside . The captain had been sent to the ship to repair the ship . The command had been left behind , and was not to be used again . He was to be sent to a new planet , but he was not told to go there . He would be sent back to his ship , but there was a new mission . It took him a while to figure out how to get there . It seemed like an impossible mission , but it had to happen . He knew that the mission was to destroy the aliens and destroy the ships . He did n't know how , but the ship was built to do it . He could not stop it . The men and women who had been selected for the mission were sent to another planet . He went to the planet , and began to search for the ship that was supposed to be the last . He found it .

I was just a kid , a child , a kid who thought I was a hero . I thought I ' was a good guy . I did n't think I was going to die . I told myself that I would n't die , but now I know I did . I ca't believe I did , but it 'll be okay . I know it will be okay , because I know that I ' will be alive . I guess I just ca n' be a hero , but if I do n ' t be , I 'M going to be a loser . I do 'm going to go to hell . I am going to lose . I have no choice . I will be a monster . I wo n't be able T-minus five years . I just want to be able . I want to die , I want it to be over . I can not go to my grave knowing that I was the one who will be the one to die ... I 're going to have to die in the first place . I hope you 're all having a good day , and I hope that you 'll all be happy . I love you all . I loved you all , and you 've all been a great part of my life . I wish I could be here , but the world is not mine to control . I could n't bear to watch you all die . You were all good people , but you were n't good enough . I miss you all so much . I still have n't had a good night . I feel like I 's going to wake up tomorrow . I wan na go to sleep . I really do . I need to sleep , but what do I do ? I need a drink . I should n't have to drink . It 's too late for that . I woke up this morning to the sound of my alarm clock , and the sound made me jump . I jumped up , but then I realized that it was too late . I got up and went to the bathroom . I looked at my clock . It was 8:40 . I threw on a robe and went out into the hallway . I went to my bedroom and pulled out my phone . I checked my watch . It read 8:50 . I walked down the hallway and turned on the light . I had to get to the living room . I saw my wife , my son , my daughter , and my brother . I ran into the livingroom and ran to my room . As I walked in , I saw the lights on my bed . I turned on my phone and saw the message . I opened it and read the message : `` I have a match with the Galactic Deathball , and we 're winning . Assemble your team of 20 humans . If you lose , the planet will be destroyed . If we win , we 'll destroy you . If not , we will be damn . '' I opened the message and read it again . It had the same message : '' I am the Galactic deathball , you have a team of twenty humans . Assembling your team , we are winning . If I win , the world will be torn apart . If if I lose , you will be damned . If your team wins , we wo n 't be damned , we would be damned '' I looked out the window . I felt a cold sweat run down my face . I started to cry . I knew I was gon na die .",4,0

AMT_D6,"`` I 'm sorry , but we ca n't stop . '' He was the only one who had n't lost his mind . The others were already dead . He was n't even sure why . The zombies had been walking around the mall for weeks now . They had nned the mall , and they were the only ones who had survived . He had npnged his life . `` I 've been walking for hours . '' `` You 've had enough . '' The zombies were n't going to let him out of their sight . `` No , you 're not . '' he said . `` You need to stop . I 'll be okay . '' They were nuggets of hope , a few of the zombies . He could n't wait for his wife to come home . `` How ? '' `` I do n't know . '' She was n't home . He 'd gone to work . He knew it . `` It 's just ... it 's not fair . '' His wife was dead . She was just another zombie . He thought he was dead , but he knew he was n n't . He did n't want to be . He wanted to be with her . He just wanted to see her again . He looked at the zombies , who were just as confused as he was . `` What 's the matter ? '' He asked . He heard a voice . `` My wife is dead . '' It was the man he 'd been dating . He gave him a hug and a kiss . He told him he was sorry . He walked over to the zombies and said , `` I love you . '' There was a pause . `` And I love the zombies too . '' Then he said , '' I love them too . I love all of them . '' And he walked away . `` So , you know what ? '' The zombie asked . `` If you love them , I love everyone . '' A few of them looked at him . `` We 're going to be fine . '' said the zombie . `` But we 're still alive . '' . `` Do n't you think ? '' he asked . The zombie laughed . `` Yes . '' the zombie said . The other zombies laughed . He laughed . They laughed . The last zombies left . `` They 're all dead . I guess I 'd better go . '' -- -- -- - I ' m not a writer , so I 's going to do a prompt prompt prompt .","SLAM ! Some guy drops into the backseat “ FOLLOW THAT- ” and I ’ m off . It ’ s a black sedan . It ’ s always the black sedan . I am so fed up with this shit . I finally land a job that should be decent , should even be a little fun , but no . I have to deal , almost exclusively , with these wackjobs . “ Okay , What the everloving shit is it this time ? ” I asked , as the little mazda ’ s four cylinders strained to keep me above 80 ( in a 40 mph zone , mind you ) which was , impossibly , mostly free of traffic . Why can ’ t the streets ever be this clear in this city when I ’ m NOT dealing with some wacko trying to save the free world or catch his wife or whatever ? “ Russian nukes again ? That was fun . Someone shot out my windshield on that one. ” I grit my teeth , as I pull into a handbrake turn “ Somebody kidnap your kid ? ” The man in the back ’ s face was a mask of determination , eyes locked on the car in front of us . “ Concentrate on driving . We can ’ t afford to loose him , Not again. ” That ’ s it . The breaks squealed as my car skidded to a halt in the middle of a overpass . That snapped the twat out of his thousand yard stare . “ NO ! You can ’ t stop ! If he gets away again , there ’ s no telling how may people might die ! ” For anybody else , that ’ d be a worthy argument . However , I lived through the aforementioned Russian nuke fiasco mentioned above . So relative to World War III , I think this guy could afford to chill for a bit . “ Not going anywhere , pal ” I said , rolling down the window . And there ’ s the gun . In my face . Again . “ I was trying to be nice , but to be perfectly honest , you don ’ t really have a choice . Drive. ” Unfortunately for his ass , that only works the first two times . “ Actually , mister double-oh-I-don ’ t-give-a-shit , I do. ” I stated calmly , staring him down . “ See , right now , the doors are locked , and the keys are hanging off the side of this overpass by a string . Shoot me , and I let go of it . And you ’ re trapped in a locked cab with a dead body , while whoever the hell we ’ re following goes wherever he wants . Seem fun ? ” His face shifted slightly , eyes narrowing . “ So , why are you doing this ? Who are you working for ? ” His tone , was perfectly calm . Like he was asking about the weather . The dissonance would send shivers down my spine , if I wasn ’ t so suicidally mad at all of reality at the moment . “ I work for Edwards Taxi . AND NOBODY ELSE , OKAY ! ” my voice naturally rose into a shout . “ I JUST WANT TO MAKE A DECENT LIVING , BUT NO ! EVERY SINGLE DAY I HAVE TO DEAL WITH MOTHERFUCKERS LIKE YOU. ” He blinked . “ Like me ? ” “ YEAH , JUST LIKE YOU ! Mob men , people running from mob men , assassins , targets , spies of EVERY POSSIBLE NATIONALITY , and that one archaeologist TWAT who always has people shooting at him ! ” a tear rolled down my face .

'' The old Man looked at me , and laughed . `` And I ' ll do it . '' _______________________________________________________________ The ritual was simple , really . It consisted of a small ritual . A woman was to be summoned from the future and a man was to come from the past . The ritual would be performed in a room , and then , when the woman was ready , she would be summoned . The man would then be summoned to the future from the present . The woman would be in a box , and she would get a small box with a small note . The box would have a small piece of paper with her name on it . The only thing she would have to do was read it , and that 's it . She would be the first to be called . She was to go to the present , and be summoned by the man . The rest of the ritual was to follow . _____________________________________________________ I looked back at the old women , and smiled . She had been a great woman . She could n'er be the kind of woman I 's mother would have wanted . She 'd been a sort of great woman , who would have been a terrific mother to my father . She did n't even have to be a woman . I glanced at the box , `` What 's this ? '' she asked . I smiled . `` It 's the ritual for the future ... '' I looked around the room , `` And it 's going to work . ''",0,1

It was here when I was a child , when I first saw it , and then I saw it again . The smell of its scents was like the smell I felt when I saw the old , old and dusty book , and the smell was like a smell of a book that you ca n't put your finger on .

I ca n not know what I was supposed to do , and what I should do . There was nothing I could do . My father was the one who had been the one to find the old book , the one that had brought me here .

I saw them , and they were me . They knew me , and we were me , but we were n't . I explained to them what I saw , and why I was here .

I grabbed the sword and I had no idea what it could do , but when I found it , it was different . It felt like a sword , but not like a swords . It did n' t feel like a Sword . It looked like a weapon , but like a wooden sword . I held it in my hands , and grabbed the book from the woman . I opened the book to the page , and began to read . I read the first page , `` A sword , a sword of the great knight , a weapon of the mighty , a tool of the king . '' It was a sword that I had never seen before . It had a dark blue color , and had a red hilt , and was made of a dark brown stone . It seemed to be made of some sort of stone that I could n't quite see . I looked at the book again , and saw it was a book of old , I had n't read it before . I picked it up and read it . `` A weapon of kings , of kings . A weapon in the power of kings and of kingship .

The children or me ? '' He says with a smile dancing on his lips as he stared down the barrel of my Glock . He was holding a remote that if pressed would send the school under the bridge forty miles in the air . The children were all oblivious to what was happening . Of course they were , they were just playing in the playground , not knowing that one false move from me , one step forward , one wrong word would kill them all . A drop of sweat slid down my face and onto the ground . If I do n't kill him now I do n't know when I 'll get the chance again . He could kill Samantha . I could n't risk that . Samantha was the light of my life , she brought me back from depression and believed in me through and through , I could n't lose her . But , these children are the future of the city . Each one of them has a bright future . Who was I to take that away from them ? `` I 'm waiting , '' He giggles `` If you put the gun down now and walk away all these happy little children can go home to see their mommy and daddys ! '' A cruel laugh breaks out from him . He knows he has me on this and I could n't do anything to stop him . With a heavy sigh I start to put my gun down . I was bent over before I realized I could n't do it . I loved Samantha too much . Images of her smile flew into my head . Her laughter , her perfect smile , her sleeping next to me , I could n't risk her life . Standing up and getting a hard grip on my Glock I stared him down with new resolve . `` Ooh what are you doing ? What about the chilllllllldreeen ? '' He giggles and waves his remote around taunting me . Taking a deep breath I close my eyes and fire . Boom . Boom . Boom . Boom . Four shots . I open my eyes and see him lying on the ground in a pool of blood . `` Hehehehe ... Say good ... bye to the pret ... ty little ... child ... ren ... Do n't wor..ry . They wo n't ... . feel ... a thing I . .. promise '' With his dying breath he presses the button on the remote and shock waves are sent throughout the city . Where the school was originally is now an ashen crater . Screams of terror erupt into the air . But I could n't do anything about it . I turned my back on him and made my way home , tears streaming down my face as I hear the cries of mothers everywhere . *Buzz Buzz Buzz* With a cough and a broken spirit I answered the phone . `` Wha ... What is it ? '' I croaked . The air was filled with ash and fire trucks were speeding past me to the site of the explosion . `` I 'm sorry.. It 's Samantha . She was volunteering at a school today to give a speak and ... '' The voice was muffled it sounded like the voice was trying to hold back a cry . But why would the voice be holding back a cry ? ? `` I 'm sorry Nick , Samantha was caught up in the explosion . I ... she 's ... she 's dead . ''",1,5

I asked , `` Are you sure ? '' They nodded , and said , 'Yes . ' I told the old one , `` Do n't worry , I 'll find the book , I will find the sword . '' And I went to find it . I went through the halls , and found the book and I found the sword , and now I know the secret of the book 's secrets . I had to find out what it was , and where it was . I grabbed the sword and I had no idea what it could do , but when I found it , it was different . It felt like a sword , but not like a swords . It did n' t feel like a Sword . It looked like a weapon , but like a wooden sword . I held it in my hands , and grabbed the book from the woman . I opened the book to the page , and began to read . I read the first page , `` A sword , a sword of the great knight , a weapon of the mighty , a tool of the king . '' It was a sword that I had never seen before . It had a dark blue color , and had a red hilt , and was made of a dark brown stone . It seemed to be made of some sort of stone that I could n't quite see . I looked at the book again , and saw it was a book of old , I had n't read it before . I picked it up and read it . `` A weapon of kings , of kings . A weapon in the power of kings and of kingship . A sword of kings that is only used by kings . It is a weapon that is a sword to protect the king and his family . A Sword of kings is a tool to protect his family and his","There he stood on the other side of the bridge , the sun behind his back making it seem like he was glowing . `` Well ? What 'll it be . The children or me ? '' He says with a smile dancing on his lips as he stared down the barrel of my Glock . He was holding a remote that if pressed would send the school under the bridge forty miles in the air . The children were all oblivious to what was happening . Of course they were , they were just playing in the playground , not knowing that one false move from me , one step forward , one wrong word would kill them all . A drop of sweat slid down my face and onto the ground . If I do n't kill him now I do n't know when I 'll get the chance again . He could kill Samantha . I could n't risk that . Samantha was the light of my life , she brought me back from depression and believed in me through and through , I could n't lose her . But , these children are the future of the city .

AMT_CV,"I found this very interesting as I had a very strange encounter with the lottery . @ Thenre , I am assuming you are talking about powerball ? When you posted those numbers , you never had a powerball number . So I checked the powerball history combining those 6 numbers the 4 different ways , and they never did all come up . However , using 5 as the powerball 4 numbers did come up about a month ago . Also , interestingly , at least 3 of these numbers come up with some frequency . About 9 years ago I was onto the lottery numbers , but I did not have them quite right . Then about a month later all the lottery numbers that had hit on May 26 , 2005 came up on the back of my ticket numbers . None of the tickets were worth anything , and sadly one of them with the winning 33 at the end of the ticket number , which had been the winning number on May 26 , 2005 was kept by the retailer . Then the lottery machine reset the ticket numbers and by coincidence I ended up with another lottery ticket with the same exact ticket number with the 33 at the end that I had lost ! I have a photo copy of this . After that , things got strange with the lottery . Numbers were posted at the store for the next week , yet they had not been drawn yet . I asked about this , but the lady working at the store said it must be some kind of mistake . So I got the bright idea to play these numbers , but it was a bad idea . I filled out the ticket , and on the way to the store a truck exactly like mine swerved into my lane and almost hit me head on . I almost turned around , but I thought they are only numbers . When I submitted my card , the lady at the store asked me if I was sure I wanted to play those numbers . Strange , that had never been asked before . The machine took a real long time to print out the numbers . As I was handed the ticket I looked behind me . The girl behind me was wearing a shirt with a broken heart on it . It said `` you broke it , now you have to fix it '' . I thought it must be some weird coincidence . Btw , those numbers did not come up . That night I watched Constantine at my ex wifes house , they just happened to be watching it . It was like Hell was coming out of the TV . I am normally a normal guy , but my ex and her friends could tell I was losing it . I went home , and noticed the state flag at the firehouse was inverted . Instead of a blue background and yellow seal , it had a yellow background , and blue seal . It was like I was in an alternate universe . As it got light I took my truck and went into the mountains to get away from it all . I walked up an old logging road . There were flowers that were beautiful when I walked by , but when I would turn around there would be silk worms all over them , Weird , they were not there when I walked by . It was August , and very hot . I met a couple walking down the road . Strange , no one usually hiked this road . Strangely , when they talked to me they seemed confused , and did not know what day it was . I could not find the trail to the creek , so I finally got so thirsty , and was not thinking right . I left my pants and coat at a specific forest service marking because I was so hot , walked down to the creek down a very steep bank in my shorts and t shirt , drank a bunch of water , and hiked down a very treacherous creek . I finally found the trail and hiked out to my truck and drove home . I had my wallet in my pants . Things were still askew in my mind when I hiked back up to get my pants and wallet two days later . Very strangely , my pants were not at the forest sevice marked coordinate where I put them , but on the next coordinate up ! It was like reality had changed slightly from the way it had been . Not only that , they were tearing that road up for no apparent reason . I had to go around a guy on the ungated road digging part of the road out with a backhoe . I had never seen him before , even though this was a very small town . He had his shirt off and had strange tattoos running down his back . He also had very odd pale blue eyes that were very blue . I could n't help but ask , and he said they were contacts he wore for the chicks . It was sunny out , and I never saw contacts . This was not the type of guy that looked like he would be operating a backhoe for the Forest Service . They tore the whole gated logging road and the road I drove up over the next few days , and replaced all culverts , even though it did not need to be done , almost like they were fixing whatever glitch I had caused . I told some friends what had happened and drove them up that road . They did not know what to think , but did not discount m story . I was well liked and respected around there . There were some other things that happened , but I will not get into it all . Like right when this was happening I tried to call my Mother , but there were no outgoing calls from my town long distance . Eventually , every thing returned to normal . I am not giving out my real name or where this took place . What do you all think ?","We had been sent on a divine mission . Our god , Volcano , had commanded that we go and rescue the noble savages from their invaders . But the enemy is weak : they have rejected the embrace of Volcano . They worship Water . Water is a weak god : he can not even survive on most planets , and his followers are condemned to hop between them . Sadly , we discovered that Water had populated one of our planets , as well . And the enemy was coming . Last year three enemy ships had penetrated the protective force field around the C-3801 system . We intercepted a communication : the enemy intended to occupy that solar system as a base to launch an attack on our own . But Volcano reminded us that we have a duty to save the C-3801 system . For the third planet therein has been the greatest battleground between Volcano and Water . Both gods sent missionaries to populate the planet , and a holy war erupted . Water 's minions seem to think that the humans , those lowly creatures , will aid him in building a forward assault base . The enemy has been attempting to steal them away before they receive Volcano 's enlightenment . Right now , the humans do not truly live ; they merely exist . They are observed 41 hours per day , 1312 days per year , and the scientists at home fail to see their reason for existence . We are protecting the humans from the wrath of Water , but they are slow to understand . They are indoctrinated , but we will help them . I am a doctor of humans . I fix them . My partner and I spoke to the humans before administering the cure for Water worship . `` There are some ... *unfortunate* side effects . Hallucinations , sometimes . Mild stomach pains , some swelling , loss of free will . '' `` And drowsiness . '' `` Right . Ca n't forget drowsiness . ''",2,3

I have a photo copy of this . After that , things got strange with the lottery . Numbers were posted at the store for the next week , yet they had not been drawn yet . I asked about this , but the lady working at the store said it must be some kind of mistake . So I got the bright idea to play these numbers , but it was a bad idea . I filled out the ticket , and on the way to the store a truck exactly like mine swerved into my lane and almost hit me head on . I almost turned around , but I thought they are only numbers . When I submitted my card , the lady at the store asked me if I was sure I wanted to play those numbers . Strange , that had never been asked before . The machine took a real long time to print out the numbers . As I was handed the ticket I looked behind me . The girl behind me was wearing a shirt with a broken heart on it . It said `` you broke it , now you have to fix it '' . I thought it must be some weird coincidence . Btw , those numbers did not come up . That night I watched Constantine at my ex wifes house , they just happened to be watching it . It was like Hell was coming out of the TV . I am normally a normal guy , but my ex and her friends could tell I was losing it . I went home , and noticed the state flag at the firehouse was inverted . Instead of a blue background and yellow seal , it had a yellow background , and blue seal . It was like I was in an alternate universe . As it got light I took my truck and went into the mountains to get away from it all . I walked up an old logging road . There were flowers that were beautiful when I walked by , but when I would turn around there would be silk worms all over them , Weird , they were not there when I walked by . It was August , and very hot . I met a couple walking down the road . Strange , no one usually hiked this road . Strangely , when they talked to me they seemed confused , and did not know what day it was . I could not find the trail to the creek , so I finally got so thirsty , and was not thinking right . I left my pants and coat at a specific forest service marking because I was so hot , walked down to the creek down a very steep bank in my shorts and t shirt , drank a bunch of water , and hiked down a very treacherous creek . I finally found the trail and hiked out to my truck and drove home . I had my wallet in my pants . Things were still askew in my mind when I hiked back up to get my pants and wallet two days later . Very strangely , my pants were not at the forest sevice marked coordinate where I put them , but on the next coordinate up ! It was like reality had changed slightly from the way it had been . Not only that , they were tearing that road up for no apparent reason . I had to go around a guy on the ungated road digging part of the road out with a backhoe . I had never seen him before , even though this was a very small town . He had his shirt off and had strange tattoos running down his back . He also had very odd pale blue eyes that were very blue . I could n't help but ask , and he said they were contacts he wore for the chicks . It was sunny out , and I never saw contacts . This was not the type of guy that looked like he would be operating a backhoe for the Forest Service . They tore the whole gated logging road and the road I drove up over the next few days , and replaced all culverts , even though it did not need to be done , almost like they were fixing whatever glitch I had caused . I told some friends what had happened and drove them up that road . They did not know what to think , but did not discount m story . I was well liked and respected around there . There were some other things that happened , but I will not get into it all . Like right when this was happening I tried to call my Mother , but there were no outgoing calls from my town long distance . Eventually , every thing returned to normal . I am not giving out my real name or where this took place . What do you all think ?","We had been sent on a divine mission .

Each team starts at a face of the polygon arrayed as they choose , and teams draw lots to determine the order that they chose which face where they start .

If you leave the field carrying the deathball , you choose who dies and the field reset . The game ends when all but one team is eliminated . The only restrictions on players is they must not be artificially modified members of their species , and the only equipment allowed must be worn and extend no more than roughly 4mm from the surface of the skin in one pose . Immediately it became obvious that it was a game of strength , speed and , most of all , endurance . MMArathon immediately shot up in popularity . Two more years passed before The Ship arrived to claim the contenders . We were prepared , our strategies finalized , and the team had practiced . A non-lethal form of Deathball was now a planetary sport with 8 world championships already claimed , despite the short period of time we 'd had the rules . The team , the Heroes of Earth , boarded the ship to the thunderous roar of cheering crowds . The team was comprised of some of the finest examples of physical excellence from across the planet . A few long distance sprinters built for speed , not power . Some of the most brutal martial artists to ever grace the ring . All of them with the endurance to run 30 miles and fight a dozen back to back matches at the end . When the match was about to being , every monitor , screen , and projector on the planet turned on of it 's own accord and we watched . And waited . And worried . It turns out we did n't need to worry . The aliens seemed to have the same idea that we had , send a few fast runners to get the ball and return it to pick off as many of the opposing team as possible before everyone was too worn out and the brawling began . The four minute mile was first achieved in 1954 . The Adrian could make it in three and a half minutes -- and he was on the team . The aliens had barely made it halfway to the ball by the time Adrian made it out of bounds , taking less than two minutes to cross the entire arena , barely even slowing to grab the ball . He had eliminated 7 of the opposing team before he was too tired to continue . His second , who could make a mile in three minutes and 45 seconds , eliminated 4 more . The aliens realizing they could never make it to the ball on time , tried to start next to us whenever possible and force our team members out of the arena . They lost 5 more before they gave that up as a bad job . It turns out we were significantly better grapplers than they were . Sure , they were 8 feet tall and covered in muscles in sinew , but apparently they were n't terribly dense , weighing a bit under 300 pounds , and leverage was working against them . One was literally carried overhead and tossed over the line . By the time they were down to 3 people , we still had our full 20-man team . They went into a sort of berserk rage and charged with the intent of hurting , maybe even killing one of our team outright . It ... did n't work well . Torrez played bullfighter and let one of them charge right out of the arena . Jenkins counter-charged one , headbutted it right in the gut , and somehow knocked it out with the one hit . It was ... kinda pathetic , actually . Humanity as a whole went from desperate and afraid to feeling really bad for the other team . They were outmatched from the start and never had a chance . But in deathball , there 's no sportsmanship . It 's win or die , and if we had to choose , we 'd choose win . Every time .","`` You are a very talented team Rocket .

AMT_D6,"In 2034 , the world had gone to crap . Resources were running out , wars were constantly going on , and there was no hope for any cooperation or world peace between countries .

So , Secret Government Intelligences from different countries had the bright idea that in order to change the future , you 'd have to alter the past . It was decided that they would try music to promote a better world and future . MISSION WATERLOO . This would be Sweden 's mission . To send back four individuals in the 1970 's to form a Disco group to change the world . There they stood in all their glory , beautiful space children of the future . They called themselves ABBA . They would be acclaimed as a great band with powerful messages that promote positivity in their songs . Dancing Queen would be one of the most successful `` weapons '' to change the world . Who could forget the Swedish royalty sitting as an audience to a then young ABBA performing their hearts away . It would move World Leaders worldwide to be more laid back . Money , Money , Money would raise awareness about Capitalism and would borrow time before it really took over until the mid 90 's when Big Business Corporations would finally unfortunately take over . Gim me ! Gim me ! Gim me ! would be one of the starts to push women into independence and move towards actual people that can play as hard as any man . As one of the best future musical Secret Agents I definitely want to say Thank You for the Music , ABBA , and promoting a better wonderful world . All missions from each country turned out to be successful up until the 2000 's . Remember Ziggy Stardust ? He turned out to be an alien and managed to promote a postitive influence on UK and American culture to be more open-minded and a little bit different . Nena from Germany ( I never would have guessed she was from the future ! ) would have a powerful anthem with 99 Luft Balloons to think twice about war and it 's negative effects . And this list continues ... In the 2000 's alien terrorists would get their hands on time travel as well and send back agents of their own . For example , Miley Cyrus would be sent to alter the world in being more revolting , promiscuous , and ridiculous as easy prey to the aliens that would come in 2019 . Her very mission was to try to promote twerking , a weird act that was to catch on so that aliens could easily anally probe their victims . Fortunately , it only caught on as a trend and never became successful . Yet , still we will keep fighting . The U.S. currently has Agent Katy Perry on the job trying to promote a better world . I feared for a second that she would give herself away with such obvious imagery , ie . E.T. , but luckily no one bought it and she continues to be successful with her mission with such anthems as Roar and Firework to keep on fighting the good fight .

AMT_8Z,"`` You 're the first one to make it to the Vault , '' the Courier said . `` You 've been here for a long time , '' I replied . `` I 've never been here before , '' he said . I nodded , `` I know . '' `` I have n't seen you since you were 16 . '' I said . He nodded . `` Well , I 'm sorry , '' said the Courier . `` It 's not your fault . '' He said . The Courier looked at me , and I felt a shiver run down my spine . `` No , '' replied the Lone Wanderer . `` This is n't your fault , '' they both said . They were both staring at me . `` Why are you doing this ? '' I asked . `` Because I 'd like to , '' was the reply . `` But I 'll never be able to . '' The Courier said , and then he looked at the floor . `` There are no other options . '' They both looked at each other , and the Lone Wanderler said . * '' You 'll be fine , '' * I said , `` you 'll survive . '' And he nodded . * `` I will . '' * '' But I wo n't , '' `` We 'll find you , '' The Lone Wanderers said . And I smiled . * * '' I 's right , '' she said , as she walked away . * The Lone Wandererer walked away , and they both stood there , silent . ** '' The whole time , I was the only one who could have done it . '' That was when I realized that the Courier was n't the Lone Man . * I turned to the Lone Woman , and she looked at him . `` What did you do ? '' `` You did n't do anything , '' She said . Her voice was soft , and her eyes were full of tears . `` And you were the only person I could have ever known . '' She looked at her hands . `` That 's why I do n't understand . '' she eyes widened . `` My name is the Lone Wounderer , '' then she said . She looked into his eyes , and he looked back . `` The Lone Man , '' and she said `` I was your friend . '' Then she turned and walked away from me . I looked at my hands . I felt the tears . I tried to stop them , but I could n't . I could tell that they were n't tears of happiness , but they were tears of sadness . I was a coward . I had done something wrong . The Lone Woundederer looked at his hands . He was crying . He looked at mine . `` Do n't you understand ? '' he asked . I shook my head . `` We did n’ t do anything wrong . ''","Mommy was crying again . I walked into Matty ’ s room . Matty was in his crib crying , too , but that was okay because he always cries . Mommy was in the chair and I went up to her and hugged her leg . “ Mommy , don ’ t cry , ” I said . I climbed into her lap and she hugged me , but she didn ’ t stop crying . “ I love you , ” I said . She hugged me tighter , so I patted her back . “ Do you want some water ? ” I asked . Because that ’ s what you do when people cry . “ No , ” she said . “ It ’ s okay. ” Then she laughed and hugged me more and stopped crying . “ I ’ m good because I helped you feel better , right ? ” “ Yes , you are a very good boy. ” “ Matty is bad because he made you cry again. ” “ No , ” she said . “ Matty is a baby . He cries because he has colic . He can ’ t help it. ” She picked me up and carried me out of the room . “ Why can ’ t he help it ? ” “ Because he ’ s just a baby. ” “ When I was a baby , did I cry that much ? ” Mommy smiled . “ No , ” she said . “ You were a very sweet baby. ” She pressed her nose to my nose and sniffed . I gave her a great big hug . Then she put me down and I went to play trains . Daddy didn ’ t come home until late . I was in bed . I am very sneaky . I can pretend to be asleep and fool everybody . Matty was crying again , and I heard Mommy say “ I don ’ t know if I can do this any more. ” Then she started crying again , too . I knew I had to be brave . I went out of the bed and to the closet . Then I took a deep breath . I opened the door slowly , because I was scared . “ Mumpo , ” I said .

AMT_D6,"My Dearest Shirley , Hey sweetie . I know it 's been a while since the last letter but tomorrow I drop so I figured there would n't be a better time . This place is so different from home you would n't believe it . It makes me ache for the rows of corn back in Iowa , you know , the kind we ran through when we were just kids ? I miss you , sweetie . More than you could possibly imagine . But I 'll be home before you know it . Say hi to Elise for me , unless it ends up being Junior . I love you honey , and Shirley . I discovered this letter crumpled up in man 's pocket , and wished to send it on . Letter was addressed to you so I assume you are wife . I am sorry to say that husband was killed by landmine . Please accept humble apologies and condolences . War is not who we are , I hope you have heart to forgive what we do in the name of our country , and pray that you should not have cause to defend yours . With Regret , Na Chong-hun --","So perfect . Standing in the kitchen , humming a tune only she knows orchestrating the rich smell of delicacies . The crackle of the fire , the sound of the wind outside , a soft chime of the bells , all seem to dance at her tune . God I love her . Words lodge in my throat and my sweat glands seem to have a life of my own every time I look at her . She sashays around the kitchen dancing on the tune she created . She looks as if she has been photoshopped in real life . Perfect hair , body face , lips , smile . Hell , her body is so impeccable that it must be chiseled by the Michelangelo himself ? I do n't know . I do n't know much about art . She does though . Oh yes , she could talk for hours about art and classical music and opera and all that . Me ? I can talk about football ... and beer . If beer is a good topic for conversation . You see , I am a regular Joe . Probably competing for the most boring person title . I wake up , work , come back , watch television , drool over for my wife , sleep , rinse and repeat . Nothing spectacular . Except the gem of a wife god knows how I managed to score . The train of my thought must have reached a destination beyond this dimension because it took my wife some shaking me to crash me down to this world . 'Down to earth bozo ! What are you thinking ? ! '' * '' What can I possibly think about ? Come here ! `` * I grabbed her waist and brought her down to my lap . Her lips turned to express mortification but her eyes gave her away . `` What are doing ? Stop being a caveman bozo ! '' She could n't complete the rest because I proceeded to kiss her . Fuck . The warmth of her skin melted into my soul and threatened to burn me . This is it . End me now as a happy man . Perfect . Did I say that ? My wife has a habit of sleeping early . And I know it 's going to sound weird but we sleep in different rooms as well . Maybe a lot of couples do this but once I made a mistake of sharing this with a friend and boy did I never heard the end of it . `` She 's using you . `` , `` She must be cheating with someone , '' `` She 's weird . Break up with her ' . No thanks . Initially even I thought it was weird but our sex life is hot and she is 11 on a scale of 10 , so who am I to complain ? So here I am dozing off on the sofa trying to watch some shit show on the TV . I am almost asleep but the dull thud of the clock as the time turns 10 breaks through the fabric of my dreams . My reverie 's broken , my veins are filled with a newfound zeal and lively sweat glands are back . `` Hey . '' She 's here . Now this is the part where logic escapes me . And I let it . Standing in front of me is a woman who makes my heart beat in a rhythm possibly impossible for a human being . And she 's not my wife . In fact she is opposite of my wife . She has unruly hair , a freckled face with signs of past pimple breakouts , and a very ... normal body . Like she has tummy fat and heftier thighs , unshaved legs and her own body smell . Just like magic she comes every night and disappears like magic in the morning . At first I used to get alarmed and thought about calling the police . But maybe it was something in her voice , or the loneliness that lurked in her eyes that stopped me from doing that . * '' Hi'* `` May I join you ? What are you watching ? '' * '' Eh nothing . Just flipping through channels '' * `` Mind if i join you ? '' * '' Yeah no problem'* I scoot over to the furtherest side of the couch , away from her presence . She is clouding my mind already . But no avail . Soon we got to talking . And that talking evolved to laughing , teasing and munching popcorn . She was snuggling up to me , her face towards me beckoning me to kiss her . Her smell was n't helping at all . This is wrong ! My goddess is lying in the next room . Next room ! And here I am sitting with some god-knows-who strangers thinking about all the unspeakable things . I love my wife . So why does this feels so right ? So I plunged my lips and drank her . All of her . Her taste , he scent , everything . I was drowning and she was my raft . We kissed each others marks , freckles . Explored every nook , revised every secret . I reveled in her imperfections and reached heights I did not know existed . All the thought of my mind warped itself in a tight corner of my mind .

AMT_UI,"My Dearest Shirley , Hey sweetie . I know it 's been a while since the last letter but tomorrow I drop so I figured there would n't be a better time . This place is so different from home you would n't believe it . It makes me ache for the rows of corn back in Iowa , you know , the kind we ran through when we were just kids ? I miss you , sweetie . More than you could possibly imagine . But I 'll be home before you know it . Say hi to Elise for me , unless it ends up being Junior . I love you honey , and Shirley .

The crackle of the fire , the sound of the wind outside , a soft chime of the bells , all seem to dance at her tune . God I love her .

AMT_Z2,"`` I 'm sorry , but I 'll have to follow you . '' I said , staring at the man in the car . He 'd been driving for a while , and I knew exactly where he was going . The car was a red Toyota Corolla , with a black hood and a large red sticker on the front . I could n't make out the words on the side of the car , but it was obvious it was the same car . The man in it was dressed in a black suit , and he was wearing a black tie . He was driving a red Corvette , and it was a white one . I was n't sure if he was trying to be funny or not . I did n't know what to do . I had no idea if I could get to the car or not , so I took a deep breath , and looked at the car again . I looked at him . He looked at me . I knew what he was looking at . He had a gun . I started to walk towards him , but he shot me in the face . I fell to the ground , and the car rolled to a stop . I crawled out of the vehicle and looked up . The gun was gone , and so was the man . I ran towards the car and started to run . I saw the car pull out of a parking lot and turn into a lot of yards . I found a parking space , and got in . I walked to the side . The guy in the red Corvette was still there , and was waiting for me . He took the gun out of his pocket , and pointed it at me , and shot me . The story was a bit different than I thought . The protagonist was a man , and had a white car . I watched as he drove off , and then he was gone . I realized that he was nCaught up in the action movie . I sat there , in the dust , and thought about the events of the movie . The hero , the car was nA white car , and a man in a white jacket , and there was a car behind him . I thought about how he had killed the driver , and how he was a hero . I tried to remember if I had heard the story . I remembered the car 's name . I decided to follow the car to see if I was right . I got into the car with the man , who was driving it . I felt a sudden chill , and saw the man 's face . He used his gun . He opened his mouth , and fired . I heard the sound of metal on metal , and felt the man hit the ground . I remember the man screaming . I stepped out of my car . `` I 've got to get out of here , '' I thought , and walked out of it .","`` I 'm not going to do it . I 've got enough money to get by on . '' I thought . I was always a good person . I always had enough money . I never had to worry about money . My parents were always right . I had a good life . I grew up in a good home . I did n't have to worry . I could n't afford to be poor . I do n't even have to be rich . I have enough money for the basics . I just need to keep it all together . I set it all up . I would n't be able to live on it . The money was there for me . I used it to buy food . I bought my car . I got a car . The car was a nice car . It was a good car . My daughter was born in a nice house . My wife was a great person . She was a wonderful woman . She loved me . She always did . I loved her . I spent the money I had on her . My kids . I kept it all . I saved it all for my family . I took care of my wife . I made sure my children were safe . I gave them everything they needed . I even bought them new cars . I built a house . I taught them how to work and feed them . I helped them with their homework . I put them in school . I paid for their college . I raised them to be good people . I told them I loved them .

AMT_VO,"Dear Constituent , As you know , My name is Guy Dedude , and I 'm the junior senator for our fine state . I 'm emailing you today to assure you that despite the fact that the Supreme Court decided to somehow completely ignore it Constitutional role and literally change legislation based on no existing Constitutional doctrine , Federal Statute , or rule of comity , it has decided to classify caffeine as a Schedule 1 drug . I know that this is troubling for many of us and I want you to rest assured that by the end of this week Congress will simply pass a bill completely legalizing it once more . Furthermore we will be seeking to revoke the appointment of several college freshmen political science students to the Supreme Court as they have clearly abused their power . If not for what just transpired , I would have thought that only a slack jawed , knuckle-dragging , mouth breathing , moron would ever have thought the Supreme Court had the power to reclassify a drug .

King Cornell stood anxiously by the fire of his tall nebulous castle . His room was the definition of regal . It was his father 's . Cornell looked at his posthumous portrait of the leader brought his kingdom peace . He always held his tongue and always made eye contact , even for a fleeting moment . Cyrus was approaching . After the coup attempt Cyrus needed to assert his dominance . Being a former noble himself he sought to take the throne of his generous childhood friend . He thought it was necessary . Cornell now had to ensure that he had the sword of center . The center sword clings loudly against the rocks . The thief sprints across enemy lines and down through the impressive moat between the castle . It was cold . Cyrus was in angst over the loss of the sword , the keepsake of his country . As a child he would watch it gleam in the old kings cabinet . Now he needed it to calm his country . It would show his prominence . Maybe he could claim more . Cornell knew that Cyrus was coming . Someone was closer . Cornell looked at his contracted thief in full knowledge of time of arrival . This was one of the best thieves in the known world . This thief was promised death many times . Cornell was tense . He could be killed instantly by the contracted hooded figure . The sword was placed in his hands under the cover of purple crushed velvet . The seven families names gleamed under the hearth and reflected into his eyes . The dry blood of his father shook him to his core . The thief did not make eye contact . He gave the king a couple minutes to fully acknowledge what he had received . He had to kill Cyrus with the blade . Cornell looked out of the window wistfully . The thief took the initiative to remove all assumption of all hostility by the fire . Darkness yielded for the king , the moonlight cast a spell on the landscape . Cornell did not trust this agent , but he did not believe the crossing of their paths came so casually . The guild sent their best , the only one that knew the king well . The thief undressed by the fire , seeking relief from the long journey and frigidity of the moment . With a face to the fire , a green eye peeled over a shoulder took a look at the sullen desperate king . Legs folded by the fire , upright . The daughter of the fallen noble , she carefully removed her soaked clothes by the fire . Cornell bewildered only saw the damaged skin on her back and one green eye held well in contact with him . Many years have passed since they last met . About a dozen actually . Cornell sat by the flames and shed a tear . Her father made this sword . Cornell felt stabbed with no wounds . She kept rigid , facing the fire looking left at her childhood peer . Christie had to outgrow the shame , and had to work hard . The look on her face was as if it was carved in . Her father was noble , she put up with Cyrus and Cornells games . Even though she was only the daughter of a Duke , she was made to be their playmate and servant . After her father died in a freak accident she was ordered to be executed . Cornell : And destiny has brought you back here . Christie : ... . ( Stares ) . Cornell : I ’ ve cursed you one more time . And forever at that . Christie : It 's one heavy ass sword . Cornell : The sins are etched in every letter . Christie : ….Quite the room you have . Cornell : I like the atrium better . We used to play hide and seek when you did n't have chores . Christie : That atrium ? It was frighteningly enormous . Took an hour to clean . Cornell : And charles would never find me , he always would ask you know who to find me . Christie : He would rub his glasses every once in awhile and just not put them on . Cornell : Ha . He always says that he lost a pair . Christie : I remember when cyrus decided to hide in the potting jar . Or was it a fountain ? Cornell : They ’ re all fountains now . It was a jar because… Christie : I had to clean his stupid ass cause he had dirt all over him . Cornell : Did he ever apologize ? Christie : He said sorry , then invited me to dinner . Cornell : Did he start a war after that ? Christie : Nope , but i think i should have . Cornell : War at 12 ? Christie : 11 dishes for the archduke ’ s son . By his maid ! The madness . Cornell : You mean my maid . Christie : I ’ ve made up your bed and his and i 've always slept in my own . Cornell : Liar , you never needed sleep . I could never get any wine out of the cellar . Christie : Sleep was for mortals . And you could never find the key to that cellar now could you . Cornell : Whenever that cellar was open we could say whatever we wanted . Christie : That crap is poison . Cornell : Poison makes for good cooking . Christie : How much you have left ? Cornell : It ’ s all for the man walking up the steps to come and kill us . Its all thats left of my kingdom . How much poison do you have left ? Christie : Just Enough . [ Erotica or death ensues . ]",4,2

Someone was closer . Cornell looked at his contracted thief in full knowledge of time of arrival . This was one of the best thieves in the known world . This thief was promised death many times . Cornell was tense . He could be killed instantly by the contracted hooded figure . The sword was placed in his hands under the cover of purple crushed velvet . The seven families names gleamed under the hearth and reflected into his eyes . The dry blood of his father shook him to his core . The thief did not make eye contact . He gave the king a couple minutes to fully acknowledge what he had received . He had to kill Cyrus with the blade . Cornell looked out of the window wistfully .

Many years have passed since they last met . About a dozen actually . Cornell sat by the flames and shed a tear . Her father made this sword . Cornell felt stabbed with no wounds .

AMT_FM,"It wasn ’ t noticeable at first . Autocorrect mistakes happen to everyone . A few more “ Thank Dog ” s or “ can you get some cock from the store ” instead of coke . Silly , harmless things . Everyone knew that relaying too much on technology would be awful for communication . More breakups were blamed on online dating and the delayed adulthood of this generation . No one believed in the sanctity of marriage anymore either so of course the divorce rate would go up . Then friendships started to crack .

AMT_OV,"`` Ninety seconds to impact , '' I called across the cabin . Hundreds of blinking lights around me coloured my vision green and red and amber . Captain Andersdottir waved her hand slowly , her eyes fixed on Europa in the distance . `` Navigation , '' she called out calmly , running through the final systems check . `` Navigation is go , we are in a stable Jovian orbit and have a clear view of Europa for the duration , '' Lieutenant Tanaka stated flatly . We 'd been in orbit around Jupiter for ten days now with no problems . `` Sciences ? '' `` Analysis software is good-to-go , '' Dr. Hauptman said quietly , staring blankly at her monitors . `` Communications ? '' Andersdottir asked , turning to Lieutenant Gonzales-Smith . `` We 're five-by-five , channel is clear . '' `` Good , '' Andersdottir said as she turned back to face the icy moon . From here it looked about three-quarters the size of a full moon on Earth . We would n't be able to see the impact itself , but the data would arrive almost immediately . `` Telemetry , '' she continued . `` Telemetry is within 0.05 deviation , '' I said , reading the numbers off the tiny screen at my station . `` *Galileo XXV* payload impact in ... thirty seconds . '' We all turned to observe the moon , holding our collective breath as twenty-four satellites on six orbital paths around Europa stood ready . They 'd been collecting data since we 'd arrived , but their true purpose was about to unfold . `` Count from ten , Singh , '' Andersdottir said quietly , hesitant to break the silence . I watched the countdown clock tick down , then ... . `` Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five -- payload will impact the surface in two ... one ... radar confirms payload has reached the target . '' The idea was pretty simple . *Galileo XXV* was essentially a rocket with a 125-foot tungsten rod at the tip . It orbited Europa for six days , making slight adjustments to put it into an orbit with a high-altitude apogee . Today , about three hours ago , *Galileo XXV* reached its apogee , made a sudden adjustment , and began plummeting toward Europa . Seventeen minutes ago the satellite went full blast on its reverse thrusters , releasing the tungsten rod and allowing its inertia ( and Europa 's gravity ) to pull it to the surface . Once the rod hit the icy surface , it was falling at something like 22,300 kilometers per hour ; the force of the impact pushed it through seven kilometers of ice ( the thinnest portion we could realistically hit ) , then it plummeted through about 3 kilometers of water before slowly sinking 99 more kilometers to the bottom of the ocean . The impact was significant , enough so that the other twenty-four satellites could measure the shockwave through the ocean below the ice . If the shockwave hit something more dense than the surrounding water , it 'd slow down ; if it hit something less dense , it 'd speed up . Simple . But there was still 76 minutes before the shockwave completely travelled around Europa , so we sat back and checked all the systems for the hundredth time today . `` Hold on ... yeah , something 's come up already . '' We turned to face Hauptman 's station . It was obvious what she was looking at : an oval patch of extremely dense materials , a bright red shape on a green background . Then two more . Then five or six , all ovular but of different lengths . Suddenly the signal cut out . `` Comms ! '' Andersdottir shouted . Gonzales-Smith rushed back to his station , turning a number of dials and throwing a headset over his ears . `` Captain , there 's some sort of signal stepping all over our broadcast . I 'm reading multiple sources , intermittent . Triangulating now ... . '' We watched as he typed in a command and stared at his screen . `` Ma'am , they 're ... coming from Europa ... . '' `` Multiple sources ? '' Andersdottir asked . `` Can you filter them out ? '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Too strong . They 're overpowering our satellites , and -- hold on -- okay , they 've all stopped , data stream is back online . '' We turned back to Hauptman 's montitor . There was a thick black stripe where the shockwave had been moving during the interruption . Naturally , the data would be stored on the satellites ; it was just a matter of retrieving them later . But to our amazement , there were now hundreds of circles , perfect circles , all congregated in a dozen clusters . `` How big are those ? '' I asked . Hauptman circled one with his finger , then tapped twice on the screen . The computer began measuring the diameters of each circle . `` Program says between 21 and 22 kilometers , average 21.45 kilometers in diameter . Density around 11,000 kilos per cubic meter . That 's as dense as lead , maybe a touch less . '' `` So huge spheres of lead-like materials scattered across Europa 's oceans , '' Andersdottir said to no one in particular . `` Is it possible that it 's a settlement of some type ? Like a European city of sorts ? '' I shrugged my shoulders ; hypotheticals were n't my thing . `` I do n't think so , '' Gonzales-Smith exclaimed after a moment 's thought . `` Those ovals we saw initially : I think those were spheres , too . But as the shockwave approached , they started moving ; the computer registered the movement because it was a pocket of density . It could n't predict movement , right ? '' We all stared at him , wondering if he was correct . If they were moving ... . `` Well , '' Hauptman interjected , `` we 'll see when the shockwave returns . There 's enough power that it 'll reverberate back to the point of origin and still be picked up by the satellites . '' And sure enough , as the second data set began coming in , there were the same hundreds of spheres , all huddled in groups near the north pole of the moon . `` Lots of movement , '' Hauptman said as he pulled up the initial picture . Sure enough , most of the spheres had shifted slightly ; strangely , none had migrated from one group to another . `` Are they ships of some sort ? '' Tanaka asked . `` Maybe submarines ? And are they broadcasting that signal ? '' `` Well , I do n't know about ships , '' Gonzales-Smith replied quietly , `` but I 've been running triangulation , and all the signals come from sphere groups . '' `` Here 's the thing , '' Hauptman said , pointing at the screen . `` They 're all quite dense , perfectly spherical , *ja* ? And they 're also all resting at the bottom of the ocean on the seabed . Obviously . No movement , very uniform sizes , capable of producing signals when affected by the shockwave . '' She stared at us all for a moment , then frowned . `` It 's possible that they 're eggs . '' `` Bullshit ! '' Tanaka shouted . `` There 's no way ! If they 're eggs , what laid them ? Something would 've appeared on the monitors , yeah ? '' `` Most likely , '' I said . `` Unless they 're exactly as dense as the water . '' Hauptman nodded his head . `` These satellites could tell the difference between olive oil and canola oil . '' `` So then they ca n't be eggs , right ? '' `` They could be , '' Andersdottir replied , her voice trembling . `` If the parent was interplantary . '' Tanaka scoffed . `` Now we 're stretching things , '' he said brusquely . `` We collect data , and the eggheads back on Earth do the hypotheticals , right ? '' `` I 'm with Tanaka , '' I said with a sigh . `` It 's a headscratcher , no doubt , but let 's get the data from the satellites and move on to Titan . '' Everyone nodded in agreement . `` Alright , we 're going to begin extraction of the data , then Tanaka 's going to program the satellites ' journey to Titan . T-minus three days until we break orbit , okay ? '' Just then , a number of alarms began blaring at Gonzales-Smith 's station . He threw on a set of headphones and watched his monitor . `` Ma'am , the signal 's back , '' he said breathlessly . `` Pretty strong , too ; it could fry out the satellites ' receivers . '' `` Switch to emergency band , order them to harden for the next six hours . '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Signal 's covering the emergency band ... . '' he turned a few dials . `` I could send it on UHF three ; that 's clear , but the instructions will take about twenty minutes at that low a frequency . '' `` Do it anyways , '' Andersdottir barked . `` And see if you can turn them away from those damned spheres ! '' Gonzales-Smith nodded , then paused for a moment . His face drained , becoming pale and sickly . `` Ma'am , '' he said shakily , his voice trembling with fear , `` the signal 's not coming from Europa . ''","`` I have been chosen to be the last human , '' I said , as I stepped into the room . `` It 's been a long time since the last time I 've been here . '' The room was filled with people , all of them in the same condition as me . I was n't sure if it was the same as the others , but I knew I was the only one who had been chosen . I had been selected to go back in time to the day humanity became extinct , but not in the way I thought I would . I 'd been chosen because I was chosen to go to the time that humanity was going to die , and I was going back to the year 2040 . I knew it was n2607 , the day the world was going down in flames . The world had been destroyed . I could n't remember the last text I 'm given , but it was a message from a man . `` I am the last person to be chosen to travel back inTime . I am here to tell you that you are the last humans alive . '' I was confused , and a little scared . `` What do you mean ? '' I asked , confused . `` The last human to be selected to travel to the future was the last one to die . '' `` You are the only human left . '' He said . `` But you are not the last . '' In a moment I was overwhelmed by the power of the message . `` You will be the first human to travel through time , '' he said . I felt a sense of dread . `` And I will be one of the last to go . '' A moment later I was in the future , and there was a man in a black suit , wearing a black hoodie and a black mask . `` How did you get here ? '' `` I was selected to be a time traveler , '' said the man . I looked at him , and he looked at me . `` Why do n't you go back ? '' He asked . `` Because I am a time traveller . '' *I 'm going to the past . * `` What ? '' The man looked at the man , and then back at me , and said , `` I 'll give you a choice . '' And he started walking away . It was a strange feeling , the feeling of being chosen . It felt like I was being taken away from my life . I did n't know how long I was to be there , but the feeling was nLIB . `` Are you going to go ? '' the man asked . I asked . He nodded . `` Will you go to that day ? '' he asked . And I nodded . He walked away . I wondered if he was going into time to see if he had any idea what he was about to see . I never asked .",5,0
AMT_NK,"`` Ninety seconds to impact , '' I called across the cabin . Hundreds of blinking lights around me coloured my vision green and red and amber . Captain Andersdottir waved her hand slowly , her eyes fixed on Europa in the distance . `` Navigation , '' she called out calmly , running through the final systems check . `` Navigation is go , we are in a stable Jovian orbit and have a clear view of Europa for the duration , '' Lieutenant Tanaka stated flatly . We 'd been in orbit around Jupiter for ten days now with no problems . `` Sciences ? '' `` Analysis software is good-to-go , '' Dr. Hauptman said quietly , staring blankly at her monitors . `` Communications ? '' Andersdottir asked , turning to Lieutenant Gonzales-Smith . `` We 're five-by-five , channel is clear . '' `` Good , '' Andersdottir said as she turned back to face the icy moon . From here it looked about three-quarters the size of a full moon on Earth . We would n't be able to see the impact itself , but the data would arrive almost immediately . `` Telemetry , '' she continued . `` Telemetry is within 0.05 deviation , '' I said , reading the numbers off the tiny screen at my station . `` *Galileo XXV* payload impact in ... thirty seconds . '' We all turned to observe the moon , holding our collective breath as twenty-four satellites on six orbital paths around Europa stood ready . They 'd been collecting data since we 'd arrived , but their true purpose was about to unfold . `` Count from ten , Singh , '' Andersdottir said quietly , hesitant to break the silence . I watched the countdown clock tick down , then ... . `` Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five -- payload will impact the surface in two ... one ... radar confirms payload has reached the target . '' The idea was pretty simple . *Galileo XXV* was essentially a rocket with a 125-foot tungsten rod at the tip . It orbited Europa for six days , making slight adjustments to put it into an orbit with a high-altitude apogee . Today , about three hours ago , *Galileo XXV* reached its apogee , made a sudden adjustment , and began plummeting toward Europa . Seventeen minutes ago the satellite went full blast on its reverse thrusters , releasing the tungsten rod and allowing its inertia ( and Europa 's gravity ) to pull it to the surface . Once the rod hit the icy surface , it was falling at something like 22,300 kilometers per hour ; the force of the impact pushed it through seven kilometers of ice ( the thinnest portion we could realistically hit ) , then it plummeted through about 3 kilometers of water before slowly sinking 99 more kilometers to the bottom of the ocean . The impact was significant , enough so that the other twenty-four satellites could measure the shockwave through the ocean below the ice . If the shockwave hit something more dense than the surrounding water , it 'd slow down ; if it hit something less dense , it 'd speed up . Simple . But there was still 76 minutes before the shockwave completely travelled around Europa , so we sat back and checked all the systems for the hundredth time today . `` Hold on ... yeah , something 's come up already . '' We turned to face Hauptman 's station . It was obvious what she was looking at : an oval patch of extremely dense materials , a bright red shape on a green background . Then two more . Then five or six , all ovular but of different lengths . Suddenly the signal cut out . `` Comms ! '' Andersdottir shouted . Gonzales-Smith rushed back to his station , turning a number of dials and throwing a headset over his ears . `` Captain , there 's some sort of signal stepping all over our broadcast . I 'm reading multiple sources , intermittent . Triangulating now ... . '' We watched as he typed in a command and stared at his screen . `` Ma'am , they 're ... coming from Europa ... . '' `` Multiple sources ? '' Andersdottir asked . `` Can you filter them out ? '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Too strong . They 're overpowering our satellites , and -- hold on -- okay , they 've all stopped , data stream is back online . '' We turned back to Hauptman 's montitor . There was a thick black stripe where the shockwave had been moving during the interruption . Naturally , the data would be stored on the satellites ; it was just a matter of retrieving them later . But to our amazement , there were now hundreds of circles , perfect circles , all congregated in a dozen clusters . `` How big are those ? '' I asked . Hauptman circled one with his finger , then tapped twice on the screen . The computer began measuring the diameters of each circle . `` Program says between 21 and 22 kilometers , average 21.45 kilometers in diameter . Density around 11,000 kilos per cubic meter . That 's as dense as lead , maybe a touch less . '' `` So huge spheres of lead-like materials scattered across Europa 's oceans , '' Andersdottir said to no one in particular . `` Is it possible that it 's a settlement of some type ? Like a European city of sorts ? '' I shrugged my shoulders ; hypotheticals were n't my thing . `` I do n't think so , '' Gonzales-Smith exclaimed after a moment 's thought . `` Those ovals we saw initially : I think those were spheres , too . But as the shockwave approached , they started moving ; the computer registered the movement because it was a pocket of density . It could n't predict movement , right ? '' We all stared at him , wondering if he was correct . If they were moving ... . `` Well , '' Hauptman interjected , `` we 'll see when the shockwave returns . There 's enough power that it 'll reverberate back to the point of origin and still be picked up by the satellites . '' And sure enough , as the second data set began coming in , there were the same hundreds of spheres , all huddled in groups near the north pole of the moon . `` Lots of movement , '' Hauptman said as he pulled up the initial picture . Sure enough , most of the spheres had shifted slightly ; strangely , none had migrated from one group to another . `` Are they ships of some sort ? '' Tanaka asked . `` Maybe submarines ? And are they broadcasting that signal ? '' `` Well , I do n't know about ships , '' Gonzales-Smith replied quietly , `` but I 've been running triangulation , and all the signals come from sphere groups . '' `` Here 's the thing , '' Hauptman said , pointing at the screen . `` They 're all quite dense , perfectly spherical , *ja* ? And they 're also all resting at the bottom of the ocean on the seabed . Obviously . No movement , very uniform sizes , capable of producing signals when affected by the shockwave . '' She stared at us all for a moment , then frowned . `` It 's possible that they 're eggs . '' `` Bullshit ! '' Tanaka shouted . `` There 's no way ! If they 're eggs , what laid them ? Something would 've appeared on the monitors , yeah ? '' `` Most likely , '' I said . `` Unless they 're exactly as dense as the water . '' Hauptman nodded his head . `` These satellites could tell the difference between olive oil and canola oil . '' `` So then they ca n't be eggs , right ? '' `` They could be , '' Andersdottir replied , her voice trembling . `` If the parent was interplantary . '' Tanaka scoffed . `` Now we 're stretching things , '' he said brusquely . `` We collect data , and the eggheads back on Earth do the hypotheticals , right ? '' `` I 'm with Tanaka , '' I said with a sigh . `` It 's a headscratcher , no doubt , but let 's get the data from the satellites and move on to Titan . '' Everyone nodded in agreement . `` Alright , we 're going to begin extraction of the data , then Tanaka 's going to program the satellites ' journey to Titan . T-minus three days until we break orbit , okay ? '' Just then , a number of alarms began blaring at Gonzales-Smith 's station . He threw on a set of headphones and watched his monitor . `` Ma'am , the signal 's back , '' he said breathlessly . `` Pretty strong , too ; it could fry out the satellites ' receivers . '' `` Switch to emergency band , order them to harden for the next six hours . '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Signal 's covering the emergency band ... . '' he turned a few dials . `` I could send it on UHF three ; that 's clear , but the instructions will take about twenty minutes at that low a frequency . '' `` Do it anyways , '' Andersdottir barked . `` And see if you can turn them away from those damned spheres ! '' Gonzales-Smith nodded , then paused for a moment .

I 'd been chosen because I was chosen to go to the time that humanity was going to die , and I was going back to the year 2040 . I knew it was n2607 , the day the world was going down in flames . The world had been destroyed . I could n't remember the last text I 'm given , but it was a message from a man . `` I am the last person to be chosen to travel back inTime . I am here to tell you that you are the last humans alive . '' I was confused , and a little scared . `` What do you mean ? '' I asked , confused . `` The last human to be selected to travel to the future was the last one to die . '' `` You are the only human left . '' He said . `` But you are not the last . '' In a moment I was overwhelmed by the power of the message . `` You will be the first human to travel through time , '' he said . I felt a sense of dread . `` And I will be one of the last to go . '' A moment later I was in the future , and there was a man in a black suit , wearing a black hoodie and a black mask . `` How did you get here ? '' `` I was selected to be a time traveler , '' said the man . I looked at him , and he looked at me . `` Why do n't you go back ? '' He asked . `` Because I am a time traveller . '' *I 'm going to the past . * `` What ? '' The man looked at the man , and then back at me , and said , `` I 'll give you a choice . '' And he started walking away . It was a strange feeling , the feeling of being chosen . It felt like I was being taken away from my life . I did n't know how long I was to be there , but the feeling was nLIB . `` Are you going to go ? '' the man asked . I asked . He nodded . `` Will you go to that day ? '' he asked . And I nodded . He walked away . I wondered if he was going into time to see if he had any idea what he was about to see . I never asked .",5,0
AMT_Z2,"`` Ninety seconds to impact , '' I called across the cabin . Hundreds of blinking lights around me coloured my vision green and red and amber . Captain Andersdottir waved her hand slowly , her eyes fixed on Europa in the distance . `` Navigation , '' she called out calmly , running through the final systems check . `` Navigation is go , we are in a stable Jovian orbit and have a clear view of Europa for the duration , '' Lieutenant Tanaka stated flatly . We 'd been in orbit around Jupiter for ten days now with no problems . `` Sciences ? '' `` Analysis software is good-to-go , '' Dr. Hauptman said quietly , staring blankly at her monitors . `` Communications ? '' Andersdottir asked , turning to Lieutenant Gonzales-Smith . `` We 're five-by-five , channel is clear . '' `` Good , '' Andersdottir said as she turned back to face the icy moon . From here it looked about three-quarters the size of a full moon on Earth . We would n't be able to see the impact itself , but the data would arrive almost immediately . `` Telemetry , '' she continued . `` Telemetry is within 0.05 deviation , '' I said , reading the numbers off the tiny screen at my station . `` *Galileo XXV* payload impact in ... thirty seconds . '' We all turned to observe the moon , holding our collective breath as twenty-four satellites on six orbital paths around Europa stood ready . They 'd been collecting data since we 'd arrived , but their true purpose was about to unfold . `` Count from ten , Singh , '' Andersdottir said quietly , hesitant to break the silence . I watched the countdown clock tick down , then ... . `` Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five -- payload will impact the surface in two ... one ... radar confirms payload has reached the target . '' The idea was pretty simple . *Galileo XXV* was essentially a rocket with a 125-foot tungsten rod at the tip . It orbited Europa for six days , making slight adjustments to put it into an orbit with a high-altitude apogee . Today , about three hours ago , *Galileo XXV* reached its apogee , made a sudden adjustment , and began plummeting toward Europa . Seventeen minutes ago the satellite went full blast on its reverse thrusters , releasing the tungsten rod and allowing its inertia ( and Europa 's gravity ) to pull it to the surface . Once the rod hit the icy surface , it was falling at something like 22,300 kilometers per hour ; the force of the impact pushed it through seven kilometers of ice ( the thinnest portion we could realistically hit ) , then it plummeted through about 3 kilometers of water before slowly sinking 99 more kilometers to the bottom of the ocean . The impact was significant , enough so that the other twenty-four satellites could measure the shockwave through the ocean below the ice . If the shockwave hit something more dense than the surrounding water , it 'd slow down ; if it hit something less dense , it 'd speed up . Simple . But there was still 76 minutes before the shockwave completely travelled around Europa , so we sat back and checked all the systems for the hundredth time today . `` Hold on ... yeah , something 's come up already . '' We turned to face Hauptman 's station . It was obvious what she was looking at : an oval patch of extremely dense materials , a bright red shape on a green background . Then two more . Then five or six , all ovular but of different lengths . Suddenly the signal cut out . `` Comms ! '' Andersdottir shouted . Gonzales-Smith rushed back to his station , turning a number of dials and throwing a headset over his ears . `` Captain , there 's some sort of signal stepping all over our broadcast . I 'm reading multiple sources , intermittent . Triangulating now ... . '' We watched as he typed in a command and stared at his screen . `` Ma'am , they 're ... coming from Europa ... . '' `` Multiple sources ? '' Andersdottir asked . `` Can you filter them out ? '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Too strong . They 're overpowering our satellites , and -- hold on -- okay , they 've all stopped , data stream is back online . '' We turned back to Hauptman 's montitor . There was a thick black stripe where the shockwave had been moving during the interruption . Naturally , the data would be stored on the satellites ; it was just a matter of retrieving them later . But to our amazement , there were now hundreds of circles , perfect circles , all congregated in a dozen clusters . `` How big are those ? '' I asked . Hauptman circled one with his finger , then tapped twice on the screen . The computer began measuring the diameters of each circle . `` Program says between 21 and 22 kilometers , average 21.45 kilometers in diameter . Density around 11,000 kilos per cubic meter . That 's as dense as lead , maybe a touch less . '' `` So huge spheres of lead-like materials scattered across Europa 's oceans , '' Andersdottir said to no one in particular . `` Is it possible that it 's a settlement of some type ? Like a European city of sorts ? '' I shrugged my shoulders ; hypotheticals were n't my thing . `` I do n't think so , '' Gonzales-Smith exclaimed after a moment 's thought . `` Those ovals we saw initially : I think those were spheres , too . But as the shockwave approached , they started moving ; the computer registered the movement because it was a pocket of density . It could n't predict movement , right ? '' We all stared at him , wondering if he was correct . If they were moving ... . `` Well , '' Hauptman interjected , `` we 'll see when the shockwave returns . There 's enough power that it 'll reverberate back to the point of origin and still be picked up by the satellites . '' And sure enough , as the second data set began coming in , there were the same hundreds of spheres , all huddled in groups near the north pole of the moon . `` Lots of movement , '' Hauptman said as he pulled up the initial picture . Sure enough , most of the spheres had shifted slightly ; strangely , none had migrated from one group to another . `` Are they ships of some sort ? '' Tanaka asked . `` Maybe submarines ? And are they broadcasting that signal ? '' `` Well , I do n't know about ships , '' Gonzales-Smith replied quietly , `` but I 've been running triangulation , and all the signals come from sphere groups . '' `` Here 's the thing , '' Hauptman said , pointing at the screen . `` They 're all quite dense , perfectly spherical , *ja* ? And they 're also all resting at the bottom of the ocean on the seabed . Obviously . No movement , very uniform sizes , capable of producing signals when affected by the shockwave . '' She stared at us all for a moment , then frowned . `` It 's possible that they 're eggs . '' `` Bullshit ! '' Tanaka shouted . `` There 's no way ! If they 're eggs , what laid them ? Something would 've appeared on the monitors , yeah ? '' `` Most likely , '' I said . `` Unless they 're exactly as dense as the water . '' Hauptman nodded his head . `` These satellites could tell the difference between olive oil and canola oil . '' `` So then they ca n't be eggs , right ? '' `` They could be , '' Andersdottir replied , her voice trembling . `` If the parent was interplantary . '' Tanaka scoffed . `` Now we 're stretching things , '' he said brusquely . `` We collect data , and the eggheads back on Earth do the hypotheticals , right ? '' `` I 'm with Tanaka , '' I said with a sigh . `` It 's a headscratcher , no doubt , but let 's get the data from the satellites and move on to Titan . '' Everyone nodded in agreement . `` Alright , we 're going to begin extraction of the data , then Tanaka 's going to program the satellites ' journey to Titan . T-minus three days until we break orbit , okay ? '' Just then , a number of alarms began blaring at Gonzales-Smith 's station . He threw on a set of headphones and watched his monitor . `` Ma'am , the signal 's back , '' he said breathlessly . `` Pretty strong , too ; it could fry out the satellites ' receivers . '' `` Switch to emergency band , order them to harden for the next six hours . '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Signal 's covering the emergency band ... . '' he turned a few dials . `` I could send it on UHF three ; that 's clear , but the instructions will take about twenty minutes at that low a frequency . '' `` Do it anyways , '' Andersdottir barked . `` And see if you can turn them away from those damned spheres ! '' Gonzales-Smith nodded , then paused for a moment . His face drained , becoming pale and sickly . `` Ma'am , '' he said shakily , his voice trembling with fear , `` the signal 's not coming from Europa . ''","`` I have been chosen to be the last human , '' I said , as I stepped into the room . `` It 's been a long time since the last time I 've been here .

'' -- -- -- - I was sitting in my bed , watching the TV . I had just finished watching a movie , when I heard a knock on the door . I took a deep breath , and answered it . `` Hello ? '' The man in the suit said . The man with the black tie said , `` I am here to replace you . I 'LL GET YOU BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK ! '' I could n't believe my eyes . I could have sworn I had seen this man before , but this was different . `` What ? '' he asked . I looked over at my watch . It was almost midnight . I turned the television off , and turned to the door , and the man with black tie had already walked out . `` Are you alright ? '' the man asked . He turned back to me . I asked him , `` How did you know my name ? '' . `` Well , you know how I know my identity , '' the mans voice said . His voice was different , and I could hear the words . `` Have you ever been in love ? '' My eyes widened . `` Yes , '' his voice was a little lower , and it sounded like he was trying to be quiet . `` Why ? '' His voice sounded like it was trying not to be loud . `` To be honest , I was n't sure if I could tell . '' My heart was racing . `` Can you tell me your name ? Do you have a name ? I mean , I have n't seen you before . '' His lips moved , and his eyes were wide . `` And what 's your name , '' my voice was shaking . `` Yup , '' said the man in black . `` My name is ... '' `` Y-Y-Yup . ''",5,2

AMT_D6,"It was a perfect world . Nobody fought wars , it caused the Link too much pain , everyone had food , it weakened the Link otherwise . Humans had evolved , their mental consciousness linked . Thoughts and feelings shared between every human . Everyone had become equal , because it was no longer a fight over single bodies . It was only they . When two people were from the same bloodline , or shared a bond like no other , this was called MentalLink . It made the two people closer than ever , without being able to read thoughts . The Link was essential to every human . It shared knowledge , education , happiness , and death . Even though we could now feel emotion , we often preferred verbal communication . When somebody was born , which was rare , mostly because since the evolution , more humans became sterile , or had more miscarriages . It did n't after much , the human average age was close to 150 . When Jamie gave birth to her boy , Konnyr , son of Dustin , both parents never felt MentalLink . The world was shocked . They should all be able to feel this child , unless it died immediately , which many had assumed . Doctors took it away , assuming it had n't survived the birth , shocked to see him perfectly healthy . They all saw him perfectly healthy . A boy not born into the Link . Doomed to be a Singular . The first one since the Evolution , over 300 years earlier . It never occurred to them that the Human race should be made up of many Singulars . No new ideas to be shared , everyone had a place , everyone was part of the Link . Konnyr was the single symbol for hope that the human race would start over again , better than before . Yet They did n't see it that way . Konnyr grew up , because They could not kill the child , in a compound . A laboratory . His eyes were extraordinary , most eyes then were dull cookouts of what they had been . His were bright green-blue , with brown spots . They wondered what it felt like , to be disconnected from something that was like a simple extension from your body . They wondered , but none ever tried . Konnyr grew up as an attraction . A monkey in a zoo for one pair of eyes , but the whole world to see . He had his own ideals , his own thoughts , his own voice . No matter how much he wanted to use them , he was kept silent , until death . He simply kept alive until he died , and without knowing it , was bringing the human race to better places . *Sidenote* : sorry I wrote this so quickly . I love the idea , and would totally write an actual short story on it .","Yesterday was a really rough day . My ears are still ringing . I can barely remember much . It 's hot as hell out here and my shirt is drenched in sweat . Maybe I just got ta clear my head with a good , long shower . Grabbing a towel and throwing my soaked t-shirt into the hamper , I headed out to the showers . Ever had that feeling you had everyone looking at you ? I could feel the judgement , but some people felt compelled to make some remarks . `` Holy Shit . '' `` Dude ... '' At that point I ran towards the shower . I did n't want to believe it , but there it was . I was marked . Looking over my shoulders at the mirror I saw not just any name , there were five . The names were blistering from my skin marked in deep blood red . I could barely make out the names cause I 'm not proficient in reading backwards . `` Thomas ! Thomas ! '' My superior yelled out . he must of heard about me being a marked man . `` Sir ... I do n't ... '' `` Save it and come with me now . Throw this on . '' he said as he grabbed a grungy and wrinkled t-shirt from a nearby hamper and tossed it at me . Walking toward his office , all eyes fell on me . Looks like word spreads fast . I could n't even have a thought to myself about how this could 've happened in the time it took to spread . Entering his office , he barked at me to take a seat . `` Alright , take off your shirt . Let 's see what we got here . '' he questioned . Doing as I was told , he forcefully pushed my head forward to see all the marks . Muttering to himself , I could barely make out the words `` mercy '' and `` shit '' . He immediately left , leaving me here possibly as a self reflection . When I joined , they said I was doing my country a service . I was told that what we did was for the greater good and in the service of the people . They said fighting on the front lines for the service was a necessity and not a crime . Yet here I am , a marked man . Marked with five names . Marked with shame . Marked as a murderer . My superior returned to the office shortly followed by his own superior . Again , his superior shoved my head back to observe the marks of shame . `` What the hell have you done soldier ? '' his superior said . `` I do n't know sir . '' I responded meekly . I 'm terrified of what 's gon na happen now . `` Sir , he was working security detail on the supply convoy with me yesterday . We were attacked but we were able to repel the enemy forces . '' My superior spoke on my behalf . `` Let the kid speak for himself , Jacobs . Did you murder these people ? '' his superior yelled out . Deep down , I tried recalling all of the events of the attack . I remember us riding through town . We were joking around in the humvee . We always said the dumbest things to help take the edge off . After all , we 're un-welcomed soldiers in a war torn country . The slow , bumpy ride was soothing , at least for me , because we were moving . No need to rush , and no signs of danger . Going through town , usually the kids and adults would come out to the streets and cheerfully greet us . It was silent and silence is never a good thing on a battlefield . No kids . No adults . Just one yell . `` RPG ! '' Then everything became a blur . I remember jumping out of the humvee and returning fire to protect my friends and fellow soldiers , but that 's about it . I tried to tell my superiors what I remembered but I just could n't remember the rest . `` Jacobs , look at the names . It 's a god damn family . This is a fucking PR nightmare . '' his superior scoffed . `` Jesus Daniel , is that all you care about ? He fought like hell to protect our unit and the convoy . It could 've been collateral . '' my superior barked back . I do n't know what 's worse . The thought of me murdering them in cold blood or that I accidentally did so . I 've killed so many enemies before without a hesitation . What could 've happen to make me a marked man ? `` Collateral or not , a fucking family is dead because of him . The truth does n't matter in the eyes of the people . A marked man is a marked man . He 'll be dishonorably discharged . '' He 's right . I do n't know how or why , but these marks proves I 'm responsible . Regardless of intent . `` This is fucking bullshit Daniel .

AMT_KV,"In the aftermath of the Euchidian Wars , Dresdoks and Prelons alike came together on the fields of Breddain to shake hands and decide on the new order that would tie together not only their peoples but their cultures and their cities so that a Dresdok could go into a Prelon city without fear , and a Prelon could go into a Desdok hovel and know comfort and eat good food , where the children of these diverse people would play with one another in the schoolyards and these people would be as one for all time until the Dragons came and rent it all asunder .

My voice trembled . `` Did you know I 'meter ? '' We walked to the door . `` There 's no way I 'M a thief ! '' I shouted . `` That 's not a proper way to say it . '' she said . She lifted the wand .

I pulled the phone away from my ear and looked at the screen . `` Hey , what 's the matter ?

'' `` You 're not going to believe this , '' I said , `` but I 'm going to take it . '' `` What is it ? '' he asked , `` what 'd you do ? '' He looked at me , and I could tell he was n Lily . `` It 's a gummies bear . '' I looked at him and he looked at my face , and then at the gummies . `` Do n't you understand ?

My father , who was napping on the couch , looked at her , and said , “ I 'll be mad too , but she 'll get it . You 'll just have to be patient. ” I looked down at my nephew and he was crying again . I started to cry . `` Mommy , '' said my mother , and she was crying too . I grabbed my phone and called my father , `` I 'd better go to the bathroom . '' And I walked out of the room and into the hallway . I went to the door and closed it , and went to my bedroom . I picked up the gummys , and threw them in the garbage . I opened the door to my room and started to walk down the hallway to the kitchen . I heard my wife and daughter scream , and my daughter cry .

The initial stimulus has been disseminated . It has had the initial expected effect of producing a marked rise in the rate of inflation by 2.4 % . This is due to the printing and borrowing of money needed to finance the economic stimulus in the short-run . Economic analysis committees have projected that based on Census data , National Birth rates and Retirement statistics , 688 Billion USD would be needed for 2017 Q1 - Q4 .

The initial stimulus is currently in Phase 3 . The overall positive effect of the stimulus has been retarded by the wealth re-distribution caused by the older-biased workforce . While the initial spending of the youth demographic acted to bolster the economy in terms of an overall rise in GDP , because of the disproportionate wealth to income ( most are outside of the workforce , unemployed , or in jobs making less that 15,000 USD per year ) , this demographic overall has not had the ability to sustain its high level of discretionary spending for any prolonged period of time . Most notably , when the stimulus package has been exhausted , the wealth returns to their older counterparts who possess the skills and knowledge to provide the good and services that the younger markets were initially paying to own and use .

Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— JUNE 22 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . The initial stimulus is currently in Phase 2 . As predicted higher overall national spending has led to an increase in GDP and private sector investment as younger markets tend to spend more than their older counterparts instead of saving for the future . This is acted to increase the national GDP and has lifted the strength of the dollar overseas . The Federal Reserve has also instituted a step policy by which the stimulus packages are being released in batches in order to throttle inflation and prevent a glut of money supply in the markets . There have been reports of increases in litigation as some parents attempt to hold in trust the stimulus on behalf of their children , some against their wishes . These are isolated and not expected to increase . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— SEPTEMBER 22 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . The initial stimulus is currently in Phase 3 . The overall positive effect of the stimulus has been retarded by the wealth re-distribution caused by the older-biased workforce . While the initial spending of the youth demographic acted to bolster the economy in terms of an overall rise in GDP , because of the disproportionate wealth to income ( most are outside of the workforce , unemployed , or in jobs making less that 15,000 USD per year ) , this demographic overall has not had the ability to sustain its high level of discretionary spending for any prolonged period of time . Most notably , when the stimulus package has been exhausted , the wealth returns to their older counterparts who possess the skills and knowledge to provide the good and services that the younger markets were initially paying to own and use . This older demographic is more inclined to save overall and reduce the money supply recirculating . Forecasts indicate that within a few economic periods the economy will return to its pre-stimulus state . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— DECEMBER 18 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . GDP has fallen back to pre-stimulus levels as businesses are experiencing an economic downturn due to the absence of its previously bolstering young market demographics . Businesses are selling off excess latent capital previously needed during the higher demand of the early part of the economic stimulus and instituting layoffs due to the decreased demand and production . It was the Federal Reserve ’ s policy to suggest repayment of the national deficit during the times of higher GDP which has nearly offset the borrowing for the stimulus . The Federal Reserve will be lowering interest rates in the coming months to encourage spending and prevent another recession .

In the distance , he could see the helicopter surveying the other side of the lake trying to figure out where the next body could be . The past couple days had been absolute hell for him and everyone in the forestry department .

In the past few months it was discovered that the oil paintings done by famed TV Bob Ross were real locations but bodies were being found too . Three bodies later and no one could ever say this was just a coincidence but it was rumored that every single body found was charred and had looked like a Hiroshima bombing victim . A serial killer arsonist with a flair for the arts sounded too bizarre to be true but the government mandated lock down was no joke .

Dereks stopped once again to stare at the tall trees around him trying to make sense of the whole operation . Maddox Silvens was their designated babysitter from the FBI taking over his park and that was the only clear thing he got from Silvens because any other information about the operation was too high above his paygrade .

He knew it was only a matter of time before the chaos of the media would arrive when words gets out that federal agents are focusing on his park . Every single park in the country was closed and from talking with other park rangers his seemed to be the one getting most of the unwanted government attention . “ Amanda , any update on what we ’ re looking for ? ” he spoke into his walkie talkie . “ Were just about done going through all of Bob Ross ’ paintings and we have narrowed it down to about 30 paintings from the show that could look like our park , ” replied Amanda . “ Should we start looking at other works outside of the show ? ” Dereks thought for a moment “ No Amanda , were already searching this blindly for a possible needle in a haystack . I ’ m going to start heading back soon and we can over what you and Jason have narrowed it down to. ” Just then the park ranger spotted something just beyond the trees moving . He raced over cautiously hoping not to run into something dangerous . In the clearing there was a barely clothed man groaning and trying in vain to get himself up . “ SIR ARE OKAY ? ! ” he yelled out running towards the helpless man . “ My name is Park Ranger Dereks and I am here to help . How long have you been lost in the forest ? ” Derreks examined the man but he didn ’ t appear to be hurt , just week from exhaustion . There were no active orders for a missing person but judging by his raggedy condition it looked like he had been out here for a while . He moved the long hair out of the mans face but he couldn ’ t understand what he was trying to say . “ Sir save your energy , help is on the way. ” Reaching into his bag he grabbed a flare gun and shot it into the air . “ Amanda , Ive found an exhausted hiker and I need a medical airlift. ” “ Roger that Sir .

I don ’ t know where we went wrong ” “ I don ’ t care just fix it ! We can ’ t afford to lose another so tell the nerds back at HQ to get their shit straight or I will personally shove my foot up their collective asses !

He moved the long hair out of the mans face but he couldn ’ t understand what he was trying to say . “ Sir save your energy , help is on the way. ” Reaching into his bag he grabbed a flare gun and shot it into the air . “ Amanda , Ive found an exhausted hiker and I need a medical airlift. ” “ Roger that Sir . Medic has spotted your flare and help is on the way ” responded Amanda “ Run ” the lost hiker weezed in his feeble state . “ I cant do that sir , help will be here any moment ” the deep look of concern on the man ’ s face puzzled Dereks . He also couldn ’ t help but think the face looked familiar , was he a local , a frequent guest… . Dereks stared a little more “ YOU ’ RE BOB R -- - “ but before he could finish the man he was holding became extremely hot and burned his hands . “ Run ! ” the mysterious man said one last time but it was too late .

The driver of his van poked his head out and yelled “ Sir ! We need to go , the target is on the move ” Without so much as saying another word he ran back to the van and they drove off .

AMT_NK,"I sat in a white room , the lights slightly dimmed . A single monitor and keyboard sat in front of me . `` Well this is disconcerting '' I turned to the scientist standing next to me `` Do I really have to go through this first ? '' The scientist frowned and marked something on his clipboard . `` We told you that a dry run was the best way for you to understand how this all works . The keyboard is the only input , the AI will see each keystroke - even if you do n't hit enter . Consider everything recorded . '' `` You know , that does n't mean you need to stand here while I type some questions into this . '' Another mark . `` Begin typing . You have 1 hour to ask as many meaningful questions as you can . This **is** being scored . '' I sighed . I started typing > How many people have you talked to ? > Of those , how many would you call a friend ? > What do you consider yourself ? I deleted my last question . `` That 's enough , you 've failed . Please step back '' I slid my chair back and stood up . This was probably the shortest interview I 'd ever had . Security clearance , physical tests , IQ , everything I thought would disqualify me somehow made me the `` ideal '' candidate to this point , and here I 'd failed in thirty seconds . I turned to face the scientist who had failed me . He was smiling . `` You really are the perfect candidate . The only one out of all the others who was not afraid of failure . '' It was my turn to frown . Did he just mock me ? `` I 'm not sure I follow '' `` Well , I tasked you with an hour to write as many questions as possible . Everything is recorded . Errors and all . Yet you took the time to ask it a clarifying question . What is the purpose of asking it how many people know of it , when the only people who *it* should know are those very same people .

I think I was in the bathroom . I looked at my hands , and saw the blood that had been there for the past three months . I saw the knife . I heard her voice . `` I 'll be back . '' I heard a voice . I froze . I recognized her voice , but it was different . I can not remember her voice anymore . It was the voice of my wife . She came into the room , and sat down next to me . She looked at me , and then at the knife , and back at me . I came to my senses . I cried . I fell to the floor , and lay there . I have no idea how long I was there . She yelled at me to get up . I stood up , and walked to the bathroom , and looked at the blade . I took a deep breath , and held it in my hand . I held it to my chest , and felt my heart rate rise . I reached for the blade , and pulled it out . I swung it at her . The blade hit her head , and her head fell to her knees . I let out a scream . I screamed and threw the blade in her face . I watched as she fell to my knees , and my heart sank . I lost her . She died . I woke up , still crying . I started crying . And I was crying . She sat on my bed , and cried with me . Her body was covered in blood . I broke down , and sobbed . I begged her to stop . She did n not . She laid there , and kissed me , then she went to the kitchen , and took the knife out of my hand , and stuck it into her mouth . I died .","It was a beautiful day in the middle of the day . The sun was shining , the air was warm , and the sky was blue . A few clouds were falling and the air smelled of fresh rain . The sky was a bright , golden shade of blue , and I could see the clouds from my window . I looked at the sky , and thought about the day we had just had . I was sitting in the living room , watching the sun set . I could hear the rain fall from the clouds and the wind was blowing . I watched the clouds move across the sky as they moved from one place to another . I did n't really care for the rain . I just wanted to watch the clouds . I had been watching the clouds for hours . I heard a noise and looked up , and there was a figure standing in the clouds , looking down at me . He was wearing a red dress , with a red bow on his head . He had a red ribbon tied around his neck . I stared at him , and he smiled . `` Hello . '' I smiled back . `` Hi . '' `` Hi , '' he said . `` You 're a good guy . '' He said . He looked around the room . `` I 'm not sure what you 're doing here . '' The man in the red dress said . I smiled . I said , `` I am . I 've been watching you for a while . '' And I could n't help but smile . `` Are you sure you want to stay here ? '' I asked . `` Yes . '' he replied . I took a deep breath . `` Do you want me to join you ? '' `` Sure . '' A minute later , he said , and then he was gone . I sat in the park , and watched the sky . I thought about my day . I wanted to see the sun rise . I decided to watch a movie . I stayed in the shade of the tree . I saw the clouds again . I liked the way the sky looked . I went to the tree again . The clouds were so pretty . I loved the way they looked . The stars were so beautiful . The rain fell . I felt the wind . I think I was going to cry . I tried to cry , but I could not . I laughed . I cried . I started to cry so hard I cried myself to sleep . I died . I woke up in the hospital . I got a call from the police . I asked them what happened . They said I was a good boy . I told them I was just a good kid . They told me to go home . I drove home .",2,2
AMT_KG,"Frodo had never been on a ship this big before . He 'd certainly never been on the bulbous bridge of an elven capital ship , with towering synthglass panels on all sides curving up impossibly and meeting a hundred feet above his head . The view out the front of the bridge made his stomach pinch . There they were : the Pillars of Creation , close enough to fill his entire field of view , gold and fluffy and immeasurably , unbearably huge . `` It is a gift ! '' shouted Boromir , the headstrong eldest son of Gondor 's king . `` A gift to the foes of Mordor . Why not use this ring ? '' Frodo eyed the ring . It sat , gleaming dully , atop the plinth in the center of the bridge where he 'd placed it a minute ago . Releasing it from his possession had left him with the most queasy feeling , his bones transformed to rubber . `` You can not wield it , '' said Aragorn , sitting back , still wrapped in the Star Ranger 's dark green coat that accompanied him everywhere . `` None of us can . The Ring answers to Sauron alone . '' Frodo would have sworn that the ring shone brighter for a moment when Aragorn pronounced its master 's name . Ah , Space Christ . This was no place for a hobbit . Frodo 's people were wayfarers , nomads . Life in zero G had left them smaller and more compact than these towering land-dwelling specimens . A hobbit 's bones were short and stout , though not as thick or durable as a dwarf 's . It was an excess of gravity that led to the stocky stature of the dwarves , who made their living excavating deep beneath the surface of dense metal planets . It was the dwarves , thought Frodo , with whom he identified most closely . Simple , proud people who made an honest living , without any of the high-tech dalliances of the elves , or the unblinking arrogance of the pure-humans . If you 'd told Frodo two weeks ago that he would be here , right now , his mates Sam and Merry and Pippin taking a tour of the engine room , and him standing on the bridge himself , surrounded by the galaxy 's most important people -- he would have told you to shove it up your exhaust pipe . Their ship had barely made it from the Shire in one piece , hounded as they were by the silent black frigates that Gandalf said were piloted by Sauron 's top commanders . If not for the assistance of Aragorn , who 'd guided them from jump point to jump point in his muted silver corsair Anduril , and even fended off the Black Riders alone for a few minutes while Frodo and the others dealt with an overheated hyperdrive , they would be nothing but molecules floating , miles apart , through the dead , empty vacuum . What brought Frodo 's attention back to the discussion at hand was the sudden movement of Gimli , one of the dwarves , who lunged out of his seat , violet light-axe crackling to life , and brought the sizzling blade down on the ring with all the force his burly arms could muster . There was a searing screech , and a crack , as the light-axe scoured a deep rut into the plinth . The ring , struck full force , simply scooted a few inches to the side and arrested itself . `` Oh , great , '' said Legolas , the snootiest elf Frodo had ever met . `` Typical dwarf . '' Before Gimli could respond , Elrond rose to his feet , extending a hand that silenced everyone at once . `` The Ring can not be destroyed , Gimli , son of Gloin , by any craft that we here possess , '' said Elrond , his voice assuming a supremely patronizing tone that Frodo prayed was unintentional . `` The Ring , '' continued Elrond , `` was made in the fires of the galaxy 's core . Only there can it be unmade . It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the supermassive black hole from whence it came . '' Acrid smoke rose up from the ruined plinth 's black gash . The smell -- like an overclocked supercomputer thinking itself to death -- seemed out of place on the glittering bridge . `` One of you , '' said Elrond , `` must do this . '' The words hung in the air , fat and unpleasant . `` One does not simply fly into Mordor , '' said Boromir after a while . `` Its systems are guarded by more than just orcs . There is evil there that does not sleep , and the great eye is ever watchful . It 's a barren wasteland , riddled with fire and ash and dust . Not with a fleet of ten thousand carriers could you do this . '' `` Did you hear nothing Lord Elrond said ? '' shouted Legolas , leaping to his feet , his long blond hair billowing . `` The Ring must be destroyed ! '' `` And I suppose you think you 're the one to do it , '' said Gimli . In a flash they were all bickering , even Gandalf , who Frodo had never taken for the argumentative type . Normally Frodo would have enjoyed this -- not every day did the highest and mightiest dwellers of the universe embarrass themselves in front of a humble Hobbit -- but for some reason he 'd developed a thrumming , red-hot headache . After a while their shouts and sneers became too much for him to stand . `` Ah , fuck , '' he shouted , `` I 'll take the damn thing . '' Everyone stopped -- Legolas even left his mouth hanging open mid-insult -- and stared at him . `` The condition is that you all have to shut up , though , '' grumbled Frodo .","`` So you know , '' she said , `` I was thinking about it .

AMT_Z2,"Frodo had never been on a ship this big before . He 'd certainly never been on the bulbous bridge of an elven capital ship , with towering synthglass panels on all sides curving up impossibly and meeting a hundred feet above his head . The view out the front of the bridge made his stomach pinch . There they were : the Pillars of Creation , close enough to fill his entire field of view , gold and fluffy and immeasurably , unbearably huge . `` It is a gift ! '' shouted Boromir , the headstrong eldest son of Gondor 's king . `` A gift to the foes of Mordor . Why not use this ring ? '' Frodo eyed the ring . It sat , gleaming dully , atop the plinth in the center of the bridge where he 'd placed it a minute ago . Releasing it from his possession had left him with the most queasy feeling , his bones transformed to rubber . `` You can not wield it , '' said Aragorn , sitting back , still wrapped in the Star Ranger 's dark green coat that accompanied him everywhere . `` None of us can . The Ring answers to Sauron alone . '' Frodo would have sworn that the ring shone brighter for a moment when Aragorn pronounced its master 's name . Ah , Space Christ . This was no place for a hobbit . Frodo 's people were wayfarers , nomads . Life in zero G had left them smaller and more compact than these towering land-dwelling specimens . A hobbit 's bones were short and stout , though not as thick or durable as a dwarf 's . It was an excess of gravity that led to the stocky stature of the dwarves , who made their living excavating deep beneath the surface of dense metal planets . It was the dwarves , thought Frodo , with whom he identified most closely . Simple , proud people who made an honest living , without any of the high-tech dalliances of the elves , or the unblinking arrogance of the pure-humans . If you 'd told Frodo two weeks ago that he would be here , right now , his mates Sam and Merry and Pippin taking a tour of the engine room , and him standing on the bridge himself , surrounded by the galaxy 's most important people -- he would have told you to shove it up your exhaust pipe . Their ship had barely made it from the Shire in one piece , hounded as they were by the silent black frigates that Gandalf said were piloted by Sauron 's top commanders . If not for the assistance of Aragorn , who 'd guided them from jump point to jump point in his muted silver corsair Anduril , and even fended off the Black Riders alone for a few minutes while Frodo and the others dealt with an overheated hyperdrive , they would be nothing but molecules floating , miles apart , through the dead , empty vacuum . What brought Frodo 's attention back to the discussion at hand was the sudden movement of Gimli , one of the dwarves , who lunged out of his seat , violet light-axe crackling to life , and brought the sizzling blade down on the ring with all the force his burly arms could muster . There was a searing screech , and a crack , as the light-axe scoured a deep rut into the plinth . The ring , struck full force , simply scooted a few inches to the side and arrested itself . `` Oh , great , '' said Legolas , the snootiest elf Frodo had ever met . `` Typical dwarf . '' Before Gimli could respond , Elrond rose to his feet , extending a hand that silenced everyone at once . `` The Ring can not be destroyed , Gimli , son of Gloin , by any craft that we here possess , '' said Elrond , his voice assuming a supremely patronizing tone that Frodo prayed was unintentional . `` The Ring , '' continued Elrond , `` was made in the fires of the galaxy 's core . Only there can it be unmade . It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the supermassive black hole from whence it came . '' Acrid smoke rose up from the ruined plinth 's black gash . The smell -- like an overclocked supercomputer thinking itself to death -- seemed out of place on the glittering bridge . `` One of you , '' said Elrond , `` must do this . '' The words hung in the air , fat and unpleasant . `` One does not simply fly into Mordor , '' said Boromir after a while . `` Its systems are guarded by more than just orcs . There is evil there that does not sleep , and the great eye is ever watchful . It 's a barren wasteland , riddled with fire and ash and dust . Not with a fleet of ten thousand carriers could you do this . '' `` Did you hear nothing Lord Elrond said ? '' shouted Legolas , leaping to his feet , his long blond hair billowing . `` The Ring must be destroyed ! '' `` And I suppose you think you 're the one to do it , '' said Gimli . In a flash they were all bickering , even Gandalf , who Frodo had never taken for the argumentative type . Normally Frodo would have enjoyed this -- not every day did the highest and mightiest dwellers of the universe embarrass themselves in front of a humble Hobbit -- but for some reason he 'd developed a thrumming , red-hot headache . After a while their shouts and sneers became too much for him to stand . `` Ah , fuck , '' he shouted , `` I 'll take the damn thing . '' Everyone stopped -- Legolas even left his mouth hanging open mid-insult -- and stared at him . `` The condition is that you all have to shut up , though , '' grumbled Frodo .","`` So you know , '' she said , `` I was thinking about it . '' `` I do n't know , I do . I guess I 'm just not sure what to think about it , '' he said , still looking at her . `` I mean , I mean ... I mean it 's not like I have to think of anything . '' She looked at him , and he looked at her , and they both knew what he was thinking . `` It 's so simple . '' He said . `` Do you know what I mean ? '' She said . He looked at the floor , and to his surprise , he saw a small piece of paper . `` Really ? '' `` Yes , '' She was shocked . `` You know , you 're right . You know it 'll be fine . '' And so he said . She looked up at him . `` What ? '' He asked . `` How do you know ? '' she asked . He thought he knew . `` Well , '' He answered . `` That 's when I noticed it . I mean I knew it was coming . '' The girl was shocked , and not in a good way . She was so shocked that she did n't say anything . She just stood there , and looked at a piece of white paper , and then she looked at his face . `` Oh , '' was all she could say . She did n Banked . He knew what she was thinking , and she knew it . She thought he was cheating . He was n't cheating . And she thought he did n couple of things . She knew he was nid- . `` But , '' the girl said , and for the first time in her life she was scared . `` He 's cheating . '' '' I know . '' he thought . He 'd seen it before . He saw her . The girl who had been a beautiful maiden , by day , by night , a beautiful woman who looks different . He had seen her in the mirror . He always knew , but he never told her . He did n 't want to hurt her . She had been his wife . She 'd been his daughter . He could n't stand it . He wanted to get out of the house , and leave her . But she was n' she was his daughter , and her father was n ' he had been her husband . He would n't leave her alone . He felt like he was a murderer .

AMT_FM,"Oh , I wrote something like this the other day . I love dragons ! : D Tears streaked from the corners of Edmund ’ s eyes , the beating of Raven ’ s gargantuan wings along with her rapid descent created so much wind that he could hardly take in a breath . His legs held fast to her scaled neck , his lithe body pressed close . Horns sharp enough to impale a man protruding from the back of her skull served as his hand holds as they banked . The tips of Raven ’ s claws skimmed the water before she reared up , throwing her hind legs forward into a jolting landing onto the beach . Edmund clambered down onto the sand and sprawled out , enjoying the sun-heated earth and the rays beating down on him . Raven was in a similar state . He had to chuckle at how similar they had become . He wondered who she would choose to fly with her when he was dead and gone , and felt a sudden pang of sharp jealousy . Would they call her Raven ? He thought back on the day he first saw her , flying high above the pastures he grew up on , circling in search of a fat calf or a grazing buck . He had thought she was an enormous black bird . Lower and lower she flew , Edmund frozen in fear as what he thought was a raven grew in size before his eyes into an enormous reptile , tar black scales each catching the sunlight , gleaming . She landed before him , snatching up a lamb into her jaws and engulfing it . She was regal , and terrifying . Her knowing eyes bored into him , considering . Edmund stood stock-still for what seemed an era , awaiting those jaws to crunch his bones . Who would harvest the grain this year ? Who would cut the wood for winter ? A thousand such trifles cascaded through his mind as he awaited death . The dragon took one step forward , then another . Edmund felt his soul exposed , a level of nudity he had never experienced . At last she stood before him , her reptilian stench filling all his senses , and she lowered her head . Fear coursed through Edmund ’ s body as his hand moved on its own accord , gliding over the intricate scaling on her brow . He felt more than heard her words . *Mine . *","`` Get up ! '' A voice thundered in the cryogenic chamber . The steel vent opened and the chilling gas that was shrouding me for god-knows-how-long was being sucked out from the chamber of mine . I rolled my eyes upward . Nov. 03016. , the green neon light flickered . I gazed at the numbers once more : 3,016 . Three thousand and sixteen , huh . You could say I 've been waiting to hear that words for eight hundred years . Did humanity really took eight hundred years to find cure for nano-machine viral infection ? I pondered . I guess the nanos were pushing the boundary of the laws of physics , but I did not expect to take it so long . Also , I thought to myself , these future employee of Cryo Corp. could learn to be a bit more polite . `` I said get up ! '' a voice thundered once more . He sure was impatient . Or was it the case that the culture of future is being rude to your patrons ? I shook the frost chips off my body and began to breath manually . I squeezed my lungs to get the last puff of cryogenic gas out from my system . Although I was a bit saddened at the thought that my family would be long gone by now , but I was prepared . In fact , the anticipation of experiencing the future was racing my heart . `` Fuckin ' get up ! '' A voice rang . A wooden stock of rifle shattered the glass of the cryogenic chamber and hit my stomach . The shards of glasses made several cuts on my arms . I groaned in pain as I vainly attempted to cover up the wounds . A big gloved hand reached me and grabbed me by the collar . The hand pulled me out of the cryogenic chamber and threw me on the dusty ground of the cryogenic chamber room . Dusty ? I ran my bleeding finger against the tile of the room . Dirt and dust and some sort of insect shells all over the floor . `` I will say this for the last damn time . Get . Up . '' said the man of the hand . He had a rifle resting on his shoulder and a thick black gas mask on his face . I reluctantly got up to my feet . I started to cough up the last bit of the cryogenic gas as I patiently waited for what was up . The man was humming to himself and reading through my patient profiles . I was going to ask what happened with the Cryo Corp. but was too intimidated to ask . Even if the future is paradise and all , I doubted he broke through the chamber glass with a good intention . `` Ah , yes , yes ... These ... match up ! '' the man mumbled to himself . He tucked the profile papers under his arm pit and pointed the rifle toward me . `` Now walk , meat bag . '' I raised my hand up and started to walk toward wherever he was pointing . The cryogenic room was in shambles . More than half the chambers were broken and looted , and fluorescent light of the ceiling of the room was out . It seemed like all the cryogenic chambers were running on the emergency batteries as I was told several centuries ago . Outside , about two dozen men in black uniform trench coats and same kind of gas masks on their face awaited both of us . `` Boss ! '' said the man with the rifle behind me , `` We 've got a match ! '' The two dozen men started to separate into two groups and revealed a man sitting on a chair behind them . He alone was donned in red . As he raised himself up from the chair , the men in black knelt before him . The man in red , who seemed to be the leader of the group , opened his arm in welcome and said : `` Ah , my liver . '' His liver . The men in red also stepped away from the hallway and led me to a room . An operating room . In the room , stood a 9-feet hunched giant covered in white rags holding a tray of surgical knives . He was spraying some liquid on them . In the corner of the room , a pile of corpses turned inside out laid dead . I recognized few of them . They all had the same nano-machine viral infection like I did . I saw where this was going . `` Liver ? '' asked the giant . `` Liver . '' answered the man in red . My ear was ringing and my tongue tasted bitter . I woke up , just to die .",5,4

Also , I thought to myself , these future employee of Cryo Corp. could learn to be a bit more polite . `` I said get up ! '' a voice thundered once more . He sure was impatient . Or was it the case that the culture of future is being rude to your patrons ? I shook the frost chips off my body and began to breath manually . I squeezed my lungs to get the last puff of cryogenic gas out from my system . Although I was a bit saddened at the thought that my family would be long gone by now , but I was prepared . In fact , the anticipation of experiencing the future was racing my heart . `` Fuckin ' get up ! '' A voice rang . A wooden stock of rifle shattered the glass of the cryogenic chamber and hit my stomach . The shards of glasses made several cuts on my arms . I groaned in pain as I vainly attempted to cover up the wounds . A big gloved hand reached me and grabbed me by the collar . The hand pulled me out of the cryogenic chamber and threw me on the dusty ground of the cryogenic chamber room . Dusty ? I ran my bleeding finger against the tile of the room . Dirt and dust and some sort of insect shells all over the floor . `` I will say this for the last damn time . Get . Up . '' said the man of the hand . He had a rifle resting on his shoulder and a thick black gas mask on his face . I reluctantly got up to my feet .

'' The two dozen men started to separate into two groups and revealed a man sitting on a chair behind them . He alone was donned in red . As he raised himself up from the chair , the men in black knelt before him . The man in red , who seemed to be the leader of the group , opened his arm in welcome and said : `` Ah , my liver . '' His liver . The men in red also stepped away from the hallway and led me to a room . An operating room . In the room , stood a 9-feet hunched giant covered in white rags holding a tray of surgical knives . He was spraying some liquid on them . In the corner of the room , a pile of corpses turned inside out laid dead . I recognized few of them . They all had the same nano-machine viral infection like I did . I saw where this was going . `` Liver ? '' asked the giant . `` Liver . '' answered the man in red . My ear was ringing and my tongue tasted bitter . I woke up , just to die .",5,5

AMT_KG,"`` Well you 've certainly picked up your cooking game since I saw you last , '' John said , gesturing with his cutlery , `` This roast beef is absolutely incredible ! '' `` Well actually this whole meal is thanks to my better half , '' replied Susan , `` He 's one hell of a chef . '' `` Oh stop it , dear . My head is big enough . '' said Scott . `` No it 's true ! '' insisted Susan , `` Scotty does almost all the cooking around here . It 's like having a personal chef ! '' `` Well ... we know how busy you are , that 's all . '' said Scott , blushing slightly . `` Well I think that 's sweet . '' chimed in Jennifer , `` Every woman likes man who can cook ! '' `` Well I make up for it in other ways ! '' John said , grinning over his wine glass , `` If you know what I mean . '' `` I 'm sure we do . '' said Scott , `` I 'll bet you 're all over those dishes after you get fed . '' `` Not if I know him ! '' exclaimed Susan , `` Neither one of us could ever keep that sink empty . It 's one of the few things we agreed on . '' `` Here here ! '' said John , raising his glass and promptly draining it . `` So tell me Susan , '' said Jennifer , hurriedly changing the subject , `` Are you still working at that law firm downtown ? '' `` Hardly ! '' exclaimed Susan , `` I have n't been at that dump in 5 years ! '' `` Susan is a bit of a free spirit ... '' Scott put in , `` She 's likely to get involved in different fields . '' `` I would n't say 'likes to ' ! '' Susan scoffed , `` I just ca n't stand working for idiots ! '' `` How many jobs have you had , Sus ? '' Asked John , ignoring Jennifer 's hushing sounds . `` Since we broke up ? Christ , has to be 6 or 7 . Definitely over the one-a-year mark , '' Susan replied , topping up her glass . `` What about you John , what are you up to these days ? '' interjected Scott . `` Who , me ? '' John laughed , `` I 'm living free is what I 'm doing . '' `` John is between jobs at the moment , '' Jennifer said quickly , `` But he has some big investments lined up . '' `` I 'm surprised you remembered ! You 're always so busy with those mutts , '' said John . `` I 'm a veterinarian , '' Jennifer explained , `` And I recently opened my own practice so I 've unfortunately been putting in some long hours . '' `` That sounds like this one ! '' crowed Susan , `` But at least that paperwork ca n't carry rabies , it can only bore you to death ! '' `` I 'm a lawyer at a firm in the city , '' put in Scott , `` I 'm hoping to make partner soon so I guess I 've been a little ... absent . '' `` Oh what kind of law do you practice ? '' inquired Jennifer . `` Environmental law ! '' said Scott , eyes lighting up `` I 'm working on a case now to establish lower limits on metal contamination standards ... '' `` This one ! '' interrupted Susan , `` Is gon na save the world all by himself ! '' `` It sounds very noble . '' said Jennifer , quietly . `` Yeah we all need to hug more trees ! '' said John with a hearty laugh . `` Can I get you anything else this evening ? '' Asked the waitress , `` Coffee , tea , dessert ? '' `` I 'd love a coffee , '' said Scott , `` it will make the drive a lot nicer . '' `` Same goes for me ! '' said Jennifer . `` I do n't want to sit around while you two leisurely sip . '' said Susan , `` Let 's hit the road . There 's coffee at home . '' `` Yeah we do n't have all night , '' added John . `` Another time I guess , '' said Scott with a sad smile . `` Alright then , here 's your bill . Thank you so much ! '' The waitress said as she dropped the wallet . `` Allow me , '' said Scott , reaching for his pocket . `` Very gracious of you ! '' said John , tipping his glass . `` We 'll split it , of course ! '' put in Jennifer , hurriedly opening her clutch . `` It 's quite alright , '' said Scott , dropping his card on the tray , `` But thank you . '' `` No , thank you !

The radio cackled to life with static . `` Ground Control to Major Tom . '' The voice sounded distant as if spoken from a tin can . `` Go ahead , Ground Control . '' `` Ground Control to Major Tom , you 've really made the grade . The papers want to know whose shirt you wear . '' Tom laughed and smiled . They 'd done it . They 'd really done it . `` Major Tom to Ground Control , you know it 's all government issue . '' The radio spoke once more . `` Tom , it 's time to the leave the capsule . If you dare .

He opened the first hatch and closed it behind him , only one piece of metal door separated him from the vacuum of space . He secured the tether to his harness and attached the air his to his pack . The hiss of oxygen greeted him and stabilized ; there were no leaks . He opened the hatch and eternity opened before him . He keyed his radio . `` Major Tom to Ground Control .

Earth shone beneath him and he slowly rotated until his view showed the moon in the distance , closer than anyone had ever been before . Around him the stars shined brighter than anyone had ever seen . `` And the stars look very different today . '' As he drifted he was suddenly struck with a deep sense of melancholy . He looked down upon the earth and all of its inhabitants busy with their lives , and he was all alone . `` For here , am I sitting in my tin can . Far above the world . Planet Earth is blue , and there 's nothing I can do . '' He reeled back into the ship and sealed the hatch . He watched as the earth slowly receded from view as his vessel sped through the dark sky with amazing speed . He saw the moon slide into view beneath him . Soon , it too was receding behind as his vessel left earth orbit . He calmed his breathing as he looked forward into the brilliant sky ablaze with distant stars . He keyed the radio and spoke once more . `` Major Tom to Ground Control . '' There was mostly static , but Ground Control sounded from a distance . `` Go ahead , Tom .

AMT_KG,"The spacecraft hummed with the noises of equipment and the low hiss of pressurized air . A single seat was in the cockpit , an astronaut strapped in with harness tight .

The waiting was long and the pressurized fuel beneath him was poised ready to erupt and launch him into the sky . `` Ground Control to Major Tom . Ground Control to Major Tom .

'' He felt for the small tinfoil package and ripped it open revealing two small , brown pills . He threw them to the back of his mouth and swallowed them down a dry throat .

AMT_CV,"Alabaster doors , unfathomably tall and unimaginably wide , shifted silently open beneath the gentle brush of Catarin 's fingertips . Glancing once more behind her , she stepped into the Temple of Ages , the stone slabs swinging shut behind her . *The Temple of Ages - an homage to the Old Gods , divine beings that granted Their chosen warriors powers beyond any mere mortal . Countless wars were fought in Their name , and countless people died to sate Their bloodlust . * Catarin could n't help but stare in awe at what stood before her . A grand hall of white marble stretched out before her , seemingly unending . Jewels and gems , silver and gold and platinum lie unmolested in ornate filigree . Crystal chandeliers hang suspended from nothing , flickering light fracturing and scattering into the darkened corners of the corridor . *Surely this hall could n't fit in the Temple , * thought Catarin , *for the plateau upon which it stands is barely large enough to support the Temple itself . This hall should have broken off from the building and fallen into the Abyss . * *None truly knows from whence it came . Some time after the Fall of the Ieryssi Empire , scholars believe , the Old Gods placed the Temple of Ages upon what was then called the Abyssal Spire . A singular column of volcanic rock juts out from the bottomless Abyss , and at its top sits the Temple . * Reminding herself of her purpose here , Catarin strode forth into the impossibly long hall . Beautiful tapestries lined the walls , depicting ancient battles and long-passed conquests . Beneath each saga , the artifact of legend stood , seeming to wait for its next champion . Catarin walked briskly past each weapon , never giving any more than a passing glance . *Excalibur , the legendary sword that Artur used to fell the armies of Myrdr . Mjolnir , the holy warhammer that Thor Odinsson wielded in his conquest of the North . The Horn of Yeshua , which razed the walls of Ierysalm itself long ago . Many have flocked to the Temple of Ages hoping to find their glory . * Catarin stepped lightly , trying her best to not disturb the dead as she moved steadily toward her charge . Bones littered the beautiful marble floor , the bleached skeletons of would-be warriors and desperate fools . Catarin knew better than to reach for one of the Old Gods ' gifts . *Pitiful , * she thought , *thinking Them anything other than fickle . * *There is only one way to reach the Temple of Ages , and that is via the bridge . The Temple stands in the middle of a bottomless chasm , an ancient volcano that has long been dormant . The bridge is no easy task to maneuver , though . It is as old as the Temple itself , and has long been rotted and frayed . * All the weapons were shining examples of ornate design , extravagant beauty and breathless wonder . All but one . Catarin stood before the altar , winded and feeling older than she began . Calloused hands lowered the cloth wraps from her face , and golden locks fell in waves as she gazed toward the image above her . *It is the First , and it will be the Last . You are the only one who can rightfully take it up , Catarin . It 's up to you to save us . * It was a crudely drawn picture . Two figures in shades of sanguine reds and earthen browns , standing in resolution . Two figures , strengthened in their fraternity . Two figures , standing in opposition . One figure , standing above the broken body of his brother . *Only you can save them , * the First whispered to her , *and I can give you the power to do it . * ... Catarin Ierys , Empress of Ruins , stared toward the Temple of Ages with a righteous fury . Its blackened facade seemed to laugh at her from atop the Spire , a cacophony of mockery that crawled beneath her skin . With a disgusted sneer , she took hold of the weapon she had traveled so far to obtain and hacked away at the moorings of the bridge . The sharpened rock sawed through the ropes with minimal effort , and within moments the rickety bridge was falling . She watched with satisfaction as it sank into the darkened depths of the Abyss . And Catarin turned and began the long journey home to kill her sister .","`` The Empire spans galaxies and seeds planets with families . They fight each other wholesale .

' When the minutes passed and I had failed to answer her , she climbed out of the bed . I could hear the faint rustling sounds of her getting dressed , but I made no move to stop her . She made her way to the bedroom door , but paused before she could grasp the handle . It was as though leaving now would signify something awful that had been brewing in the back of her mind , like a wild animal she was hiding in the broom closet that would claw and scratch and howl until it could no longer be ignored . She eventually grasped the handle and pulled the door open ever so slightly . With a brief glance and a crack in her voice that sounded as though she was suppressing a sob , I could make out the words `` ... be back shortly . '' The next morning as I gazed in horror at the wreckage that had been her car , mangled and sundered in the accident that had occurred the night before , my brain tore itself apart . All the emotions I had been feeling up to this point were entirely replaced with guilt . The voices of the policemen and paramedics that offered words of consolation and sympathy washed right over me . The din of the scene was distant , and I heard only the echo of her final words clearly in my head . `` Be right back , '' she had said . It was then that I encountered the horrible revelation that those words had been her third , and final , lie .","`` The baby was born . '' The mother said , `` The baby is connected to the world . '' `` How ? '' `` The mother and father are connected to each other . '' I asked . `` The child is connected , but not to the consciousness of the world , '' the father said , looking at me . `` But how ? '' I said . `` I do n't know . '' He said , his face a little red . `` It 's not like I could tell you . '' She said , her voice shaking . `` We 've never seen a baby disconnected . '' My eyes widened . `` Does n't that make sense ? '' She asked , her face turning red again . `` Yes , but what if it was n't connected ? '' The child looked at me , and I was shocked . `` What if it 's disconnected ? '' Her voice sounded like a broken record . `` You 're not disconnected , '' I told her . `` No , '' she said , and then she looked at the baby . `` And you 're connected to me . '' Her face was a little blue . `` Well , what if I was ? '' she asked . I had n't seen that face in years . `` Then you 'd be disconnected , too . '' she replied , and she looked around , and the baby was still blue . She was not connected to my mind . `` So , '' my voice was shaking . I looked at her , and my eyes were red . I was not sure what to say . `` Are you sure you want to do this ? '' the mother said . I shook my head . `` There is no way . '' And then she was gone . I stood up , and walked to the kitchen , and looked at my son . `` Is it okay ? '' He asked , and he looked at his father , and his father nodded . `` Do you want me to go and get you something to eat ? '' he asked . We sat down , and we ate , and they ate , then we talked . `` How do you feel about it ? '' my son asked . He asked . His father nodded , and smiled . `` This is the first time you 've ever asked me this , '' he said , as he looked down at the child . `` My name is Alex . '' Alex was a beautiful child , and it was a good thing . `` Your mother and I are connected , '' said my father . `` That 's what we are . ''",5,0

Cheekily named after the character from the popular book series , WALDO was the product of months of planning by top AI engineers and data processing technicians . Using Google and local information from databanks all over the globe , WALDO would take the top 100 recurring keywords for a search in order to create a hexidecimal code to represent the profile for all events in history , famous people , biological processes , George Clooney 's internet history , foods on a stick , 1 star restaurants on Yelp , lists of medical burn centers in the United States , superhero prompts on a subreddit , and trillions of pieces of information that comprised the recorded digital collection of humanity 's understanding of the known universe . Many bottles of champagne were popped over the creation of the project and now , both parallel universes had nothing to do but wait as WALDO silently carried out its sole purpose . `` Dunnigan , where 's WALDO at ? '' Originally meant as a joke from his supervisor , the question became a source of frustration for both as days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months . Media interest had already moved on to a famous celebrity divorce , as WALDO continued its process diligently with no end in sight . `` Well , sir , same as yesterday . No change in activity levels . '' `` Alright , well let me know if anything happens , I guess . '' `` Sure thing . '' Craig Dunnigan minimized the processing usage tools that tracked WALDO 's level of activity and resumed playing Fallout 4 . `` Another Fat Man ? Come on ... '' *Beep* `` Hm ? '' Craig alt-tabbed out of the game to see that the activity readout , which had until now remained relatively constant , had taken a sharp decline in the last ten minutes . `` Walt ... WALT ! Get in here ! '' He heard the sound of chair wheels sliding , a door opening , and then running footsteps . `` What happened ? '' `` It ... appears WALDO 's finished . '' `` Alright , well where 's the anomaly ? Pull up the data . '' After a couple of clicks , Craig had pulled up the Master Sync List . `` What am I looking at ? '' `` Well , these columns are every bit of information that was processed , but in order to save space , the information that matches up exactly is compressed and categorized . So any anomalies are going to take up more space since WALDO intentionally has no process for dealing with search terms that do n't have exact keyword matches . So I just have to sort by size ... let 's give it a minute . And there it is . This code . This is the difference . '' `` Well , what is it ? '' `` It 's in the beta column which means it 's something in their world that we do n't have . WALDO is loading up relevant local files as we speak ... Damn , this is exciting ! Ok so it appears that the relevant files were n't a search term but local files . And ... they come from the United States Federal Government ! Well theirs , not ours . File source seems to be ... well ... the Department of Defense ... No , it ca n't be . They 're plans to ... Oh , God , help us . ''",0,5

AMT_8Z,"Blood and entrails covered the ground . I walked amongst the carnage , resisting the urge to lick my lips . Glazing over the corpses , my sensitive eyes checked for any sign of life . But the explosive shell had annihilated the trench , and all the soldiers inside . Finally , one appeared , flailing and crying into the dirt . With my foot I rolled him onto his back , taking in the scene . His shirt was splattered red , ripped to shreds like the flesh beneath . The man was n't a man ; he was barely more than a kid . And yet , surrounded by troops far more seasoned , he was the only survivor . Luck was on his side . `` I ... I 'm not going to make it . '' Against the booming bombs and relentless gunfire , even my heightened hearing could barely make him out . I knelt before him , placing my hand against his heart . The rapid-beating drum in his chest was failing , slowing with each thump . `` I 'm not going to make it ... am I ? '' I moved my hand to his chin , tilting his head to the side . His peach-fuzzed cheek pressed into the gory mud . The mere sight of his neck riled me up , but I forced the cravings down . If I was n't careful , I 'd take too much , and leave too little . `` You will make it , '' I assured him . `` But you are n't going to like it . '' My fangs extended , and I began to feed .","`` No , sah . Not here . '' Frowning , I glanced over at Attenib . I 'd heard a wobble in the man 's voice that I did n't recognize . He did n't sound quite like himself . `` Atten , everything okay ? '' I asked in a lowered tone , taking a step closer to him . Damnable insects swooped down at my face , biting and stinging . I managed to smack one , and watched with vicious satisfaction as it slammed into a nearby tree trunk and then dropped , stunned , to the forest floor . I returned my attention back to my guide . After years alongside Attenib , I knew his moods well , recognized the minor twitches of the muscles beneath his nut-brown skin . I 'd worked with him long enough to trust in his uncanny ability to know just where to dig . But now , today , he looked nervous , pale despite his leathery , tanned hide . And when he looked back at me , I saw a glint of unexpected emotion in his eyes . Fear . `` Is this the wrong place to dig ? '' I asked again . I stood near him , almost shoulder to shoulder despite the oppressive , humid heat of the jungle . I 'd called a halt , so our porters huddled several steps behind , taking shelter in the shade of a large palm . Again , Attenib shook his head . `` Right place , '' he said softly . `` But wrong feeling . Not good to dig here . '' I took a moment to weigh his words . I truly believed that Attenib appreciated our arrangement , that he harbored no resentment towards my ownership of him . After all , I 'd treated him far better than his fellows , snapped up on the bidding block to work the fields until their muscles and bodies failed them . But I 'd seen his talent , and he 'd served me well . But we sat on our laurels too long , as I basked in the attention of the Royal Society and failed to note the new naturalists nipping at my heels . I 'd secured the funding for this expedition , but one of the Senior Fellows had drawn me aside and warned me that , without results , it would be my last . I looked again at Attenib . Did he know the conflict in my head ? He just looked back , waiting . I made my decision . `` Men ! Gather your tools ! '' I shouted to the hired porters . `` You lot ! Axes , to clear the area ! You others , picks and shovels ! This is the spot ! '' Attenib said nothing , but I saw him shrink back towards the camp . I should have disciplined him , I knew , but I chose to let him go . I had a dig to supervise . And soon , Attenib 's almost supernatural talent proved itself once again , as one of the porters let out a cry of surprise . `` Sah ! Over here ! '' I hurried over to the man , roughly pushing him aside before he could damage the delicate artifact . But my words died away as I stared , open mouthed , at the object . Silver metal , curved , suggesting a large cylinder . Rivets in regular lines showed where the plates were anchored together . A hatch , the glass obscured with dust and dirt . And a logo of some sort , a square of blue with white dots , next to red and white stripes . It looked like a flag , albeit one I 'd never seen before . `` What is it ? '' I asked , utterly confused . From nearby , Attenib let out another soft moan . `` Evil , '' he answered me . `` Not from this place . It does n't belong . '' I bent closer , wiping away more dirt . I saw words , now , stamped on the metal . `` Apollo , '' I read . `` What could that be ? '' Unnoticed , Attenib shrank back , in amid the trees that reminded him of his childhood when he 'd laughed and run between their trunks . His master continued to puzzle over the alien thing that he 'd felt in the ground , but Attenib could stand here no longer . With other objects , he felt their history . That drew him to those hidden beneath the earth , feeling for their long histories , disrupted but to be resumed once unearthed . It became almost beyond notice , the history of all around him , all he touched . But this object had no history at all . And as his master found the handle , reached for it , Attenib turned and fled into the trees .

I 'd worked with him long enough to trust in his uncanny ability to know just where to dig . But now , today , he looked nervous , pale despite his leathery , tanned hide . And when he looked back at me , I saw a glint of unexpected emotion in his eyes . Fear . `` Is this the wrong place to dig ? '' I asked again . I stood near him , almost shoulder to shoulder despite the oppressive , humid heat of the jungle . I 'd called a halt , so our porters huddled several steps behind , taking shelter in the shade of a large palm . Again , Attenib shook his head . `` Right place , '' he said softly . `` But wrong feeling . Not good to dig here . '' I took a moment to weigh his words . I truly believed that Attenib appreciated our arrangement , that he harbored no resentment towards my ownership of him . After all , I 'd treated him far better than his fellows , snapped up on the bidding block to work the fields until their muscles and bodies failed them . But I 'd seen his talent , and he 'd served me well . But we sat on our laurels too long , as I basked in the attention of the Royal Society and failed to note the new naturalists nipping at my heels . I 'd secured the funding for this expedition , but one of the Senior Fellows had drawn me aside and warned me that , without results , it would be my last . I looked again at Attenib . Did he know the conflict in my head ? He just looked back , waiting . I made my decision . `` Men ! Gather your tools ! '' I shouted to the hired porters . `` You lot ! Axes , to clear the area ! You others , picks and shovels ! This is the spot ! '' Attenib said nothing , but I saw him shrink back towards the camp . I should have disciplined him , I knew , but I chose to let him go . I had a dig to supervise . And soon , Attenib 's almost supernatural talent proved itself once again , as one of the porters let out a cry of surprise . `` Sah ! Over here ! '' I hurried over to the man , roughly pushing him aside before he could damage the delicate artifact . But my words died away as I stared , open mouthed , at the object . Silver metal , curved , suggesting a large cylinder . Rivets in regular lines showed where the plates were anchored together . A hatch , the glass obscured with dust and dirt . And a logo of some sort , a square of blue with white dots , next to red and white stripes . It looked like a flag , albeit one I 'd never seen before . `` What is it ? '' I asked , utterly confused . From nearby , Attenib let out another soft moan . `` Evil , '' he answered me . `` Not from this place . It does n't belong . '' I bent closer , wiping away more dirt . I saw words , now , stamped on the metal . `` Apollo , '' I read . `` What could that be ? '' Unnoticed , Attenib shrank back , in amid the trees that reminded him of his childhood when he 'd laughed and run between their trunks . His master continued to puzzle over the alien thing that he 'd felt in the ground , but Attenib could stand here no longer . With other objects , he felt their history . That drew him to those hidden beneath the earth , feeling for their long histories , disrupted but to be resumed once unearthed . It became almost beyond notice , the history of all around him , all he touched . But this object had no history at all . And as his master found the handle , reached for it , Attenib turned and fled into the trees .

But the explosive shell had annihilated the trench , and all the soldiers inside . Finally , one appeared , flailing and crying into the dirt . With my foot I rolled him onto his back , taking in the scene . His shirt was splattered red , ripped to shreds like the flesh beneath . The man was n't a man ; he was barely more than a kid . And yet , surrounded by troops far more seasoned , he was the only survivor . Luck was on his side . `` I ... I 'm not going to make it .

The rapid-beating drum in his chest was failing , slowing with each thump . `` I 'm not going to make it ... am I ? '' I moved my hand to his chin , tilting his head to the side . His peach-fuzzed cheek pressed into the gory mud . The mere sight of his neck riled me up , but I forced the cravings down .

So , it was a brisk autumn evening . The sun had just set and the golden leaves of the trees around me were settling down for a good night 's sleep . I do n't know why , but I had decided on that particular evening to go to a park and sit on a bench to think . Eventually , the park 's lamps turned on and I sat there , watching as couples of all kinds walked by . At one point , I remember sighing to myself and relaxing a bit , and then ... well , it was much later in the night . I had fallen asleep . I 'm actually not certain what time it was , but I was certain of one thing : I had to pee . I mean , I had so much urine-pressure built up , I could hardly think straight , let alone walk any distance comfortably . The trouble was that the lamps in the part had turned off and clouds now covered the sky . I had no way to navigate to the nearest bathroom , but I had to try . I drew a mental picture in my mind of where I was before I dozed off and where I needed to go . After I was fairly certain I had every detail in my head , I nodded and rose to my feet . The urine in my intestines sloshed back and forth . I could feel the floodgates about to open , but I had to carry forward ! I took a large step and tried to discern the precise distance I could go before the worst case scenario . No matter how I sliced it , I would not make it in time . So I ran . I ran as fast as I could in the darkness of night to the position the washroom should have been . Like all other faulty plans , this one failed abruptly as I ran into a tree . I fell flat on my back before feeling it . Warm liquid oozing all over my lower half . I did n't make it . For the first time in my adult life , I wet myself . At least there was no one to see , right ? I thought I could even make it home without anyone knowing . Boy was I wrong . I know it sounds weird , but at about midstream , I had the idea of unzipping my fly and peeing away from my person . It made a good amount of sense to me at the time , so I did . The problem was , I had no idea how much urine was still in my system . Some time as I was nearing the end of my urine-fountain , my pee began to glow . All of it began to glow .

AMT_FM,"Dear Ms. Lianne , You are very beautiful . Your cousin , my friend , always said it , but she could not have described the way your curly brown hair falls in front of your radiant eyes . I am fifth in line for the Nigerian throne , and I wish to see you someday . I have started to make a trust fund so that i can visit you someday , and if you could donate to it ( even just a little ) it would help my dream become glorious reality . Love , Achike Abasad , Prince of Nigeria I was furious when I received the email . I had just posted a picture on my Facebook page of my cousin and I together at a beach in California . This `` Prince '' , this scammer , had clearly been looking through my personal page and tried to use my cousin against me , staining my memory of the beautiful California sun on my back . Had he *really* thought that I would n't ask my cousin before I gave him *any* money ? So though my better judgement advised against extending the interaction , I sent him an angry email in return . He responded . Ms. Lianne , You have discovered me . I am a poor scammer working out of a crumbling office in Nigeria , and the only way I could contact you was through a scam . However , my feelings towards you , my longing to meet you , were all too real . You are a symbol of the love I have never gotten , the luxury I have been denied . Please let me video message you during work . It is strictly forbidden , but it is the only way I can think of to convince you of my good intentions . Love , Achike Abasad , Email Scammer Before I continue , I should tell you that I am an exquisitely lonely person . I inherited my wealth . I fill my time ordering from the pages of Skymall and ladies ' magazines . To find interest in me outside of my money or familial connections was intriguing , and the invitation was too good to ignore . I turned on the computer and submitted an invitation to talk through our webcams . He accepted immediately . I saw a set of crooked white teeth smiling before he leaned back from the camera and allowed me to see his whole face . His cheeks were hollow and concave and his hair was lank , but despite this I could see the seeds of attraction . He opened his mouth to speak , but before he did , a nasal voice spoke in heavily accented English from the background . `` You have n't messaged the rich woman yet ? You always were the best in the business , Achike . Having the smart to sell her that love symbol garbage- inspired . Really . Inspired . '' Achike 's face grew more tight with every word . His face flashed with anger as he stared at a location offscreen , only to disappear to a mask of panic . `` It is n't true ! '' Achike said . `` Is just what I told the boss ! The love is true ! Is- '' I closed my laptop with a slam like a gunshot . It really had sounded a lot like a gunshot . My imagination had taken another victim .","I 've been doing this for so long . I 've worked with the most evil people , the most despicable people in the world . I was a villain for so many years , and I was n't even aware that I was the only one . I could n't help it . I had to be the bad guy . I knew it . Everyone knew I was , but I never thought I would feel this way . I mean , I 'm not the best at it , but it 's just not something I can control . I have to be a good guy . My life is n't perfect . I ca n't do this . I do n't know why . I should n't have to do this , but ... I do . I know what I have done . I need to be good . I just ca n 't . I can not . I am not good . It 's not right . I did n't mean to do it . It was n' t my fault . I never meant to do anything like this . It ca n't be right . It just is n' it 'll be right , I swear . I will n't die . I wo n't be a monster . I want to be ... I want it to be right ! I want my life to be perfect . It should be . I really do . But it 'm n't . I still have to go . I guess I 'll go . They 'll believe me . I swear I will . I hope . I wish I could be good , but for what ? I 'd rather die . They can believe me , but they 're not . They ca n’ t . I ’ m not good enough . I don ’ t want to . I think I 're a monster , but that 's for the best . I feel like I ' m a monster when I 's in this state . I hate my life . I live it for the people . I hated my life for the first time in years . I wanted to be bad , but now I 'Meme me . It ’ s time to end it . If I do , I can never be good again . I love them . I used to . But I am n't good enough anymore . I always wanted to kill them . They are so good . They were my friends . They saved me . They made me feel like a real person . I loved them . But they never loved me . Not anymore . They never loved anyone . They only loved themselves . They would n't love me anymore . That 's why I ca't kill them anymore . It is n ' t right . They should be happy . I made them happy . They could be happy , but not for me . That is n'm I . I must be good enough to stop them . It has to be . It must be . They still love me . But ...

AMT_YR,"It 's a terrible thing to say , but I 'm not sure anyone ever expected it to be this bad . The aliens were a group of humans that had invaded Earth . They were the first to attack , and they were the only ones to do so . The first few years of the invasion were a disaster . The people were at first terrified . We were n't expecting a war . We thought we were fighting a war of attrition , but what we did n't expect was for them to turn on us . They never saw us coming , and we never expected them to attack us . We tried to hide , but the aliens were too quick . They had us surrounded . We retreated , and as the aliens began to get closer we were able to escape . We found ourselves in the middle of a field . We could see the ships , and the ships were moving at a snail 's pace . We had to escape , but we had to be fast . We knew the aliens could n't keep up with us . Our ships were being attacked . We ran . We did n' t know what to do , but our ships were n 't going to be able to keep up . We started running . We saw a planet in the distance . It was a beautiful planet . It had a beautiful sunset . We yelled for the aliens to stop . They did n ' t . We only had one chance to escape before they caught up . The ships were speeding towards us . The humans were the last thing we needed . We rushed forward , and then we saw the aliens . We felt their wrath . They came from the sky , and were speeding toward us . I knew they were coming . We 'd be in trouble . We should n't have taken them . We abandoned the ship . We made our way to the surface . We reached the surface , and saw the alien ships , but they were too fast . They ran at us . My ship was too slow . I was too late . I 'd made it . We fell into a crater . I saw a ship come in . It looked like it was a small ship , but it was too fast for me to get out . I had to get to the other side . I turned around . It did n ’ t look like it had any weapons . It just had a few weapons . I could n 've gotten away , but there was a ship that was too close . I jumped out of the way . The ship was still moving , and I saw the ship come towards me . I swung my ship around , and it did n’ t hit it . It landed in the crater , and a few of the aliens fell out . It took me a while to realize what had happened . I looked at the alien ship . It could n'T be a human . It didn ' t have any weapons , it was just a small spaceship . I tried to get back to the ship , and tried to run . I did n these things for a while . I ran through the ruins of the ship to the one that had n't been destroyed . I found it , and was about to jump out when I saw something . It wasn ’ s eyes . It ’ d been a human , but its eyes were dark , and there was something strange about it . They looked like they were staring at me . They just looked so ... sad . I started to run , and ran and ran . I just wanted to get away from the aliens , and get out of this planet . I fell , and fell and fell . I think I fell for one of them . I felt something move . I woke up . It felt like I was in a hospital . I got up , and looked around . There was no one around . The only thing I could see was a room with a few other people . I went to the door , and felt a hand on my shoulder . The alien was holding a gun . I shook my head . `` No . '' I said . `` Why are you here ? '' `` You are a human ! ''","It had n't been a good Wednesday . I was late to work because of a stoppage on the 6 train out of Murray Hill , my computer crashed right in the middle of my weekly marketing projections , and some asshole ate my deconstructed quinoa salad . Also I was hit by a Winnebago on my way to visit a Keffir cleansing clinic somewhere in Greenwich . How the Hell a Winnebago got into Manhattan , I have no idea , but I thought it would n't matter because I was dead . West Side Highway ; that had to be how they got here . Anyway , being dead , you can imagine how shocked I was to wake up inside said Winnebago . Also , as I looked out the window , I saw fields of corn and ... I do n't know ... Soybeans , maybe ? Well , it certainly was n't Midtown . `` Good morning ! '' a high , squeaky voice called from behind me , scaring the shit out of me . `` I see that you 're finally back from Central Afterlife Processing ; do you have your 12-324-A with affixed disposition statement ? '' I stared blankly at a pale , scrawny woman wearing clothing that had to be a hundred years out of fashion . She had a white bonnet and was covered in blood , her throat obviously torn apart . `` Wolves , '' she simply replied , `` but I have to take people 's word on it ; you 'll soon discover that you ca n't see your reflection anywhere . Your form ? '' `` Am I ... Am I dead ? ! '' I shouted . `` Quite . And from the look of it -- '' she pointed at my face -- `` you definitely saw it coming . '' I felt my face all over , to no avail . It was like feeling air . That 's when I suddenly noticed that I could n't feel the ground beneath me , or the clothes against my skin . There was nothing to smell , and it struck me that I was n't breathing , either . `` Holy shit , I 'm actually ... dead ... . '' `` Yes . As for the form , '' she continued politely , `` you 'll find it in your shirt pocket . '' I reached in and produced a small , yellowing scroll , sealed in blood-red wax . I slowly handed it to her , still reeling from the realization that I really , truly had died . And that I was on a Winnebago . A thought occurred to me : I turned to the driver 's area . But instead of the elderly couple who were the last living faces I ever saw , there were two women , probably in their early thirties . `` This is the RV that hit me , right ? '' `` Oh yes . According to your disposition statement , the last words you ever uttered as a living creature were -- and I quote -- 'damn it all to Hell ' . '' So the processor decided to damn this vehicle by having you haunt it . '' `` Forever ? ! '' I cried , not relishing an eternity in a Winnebago . Oh heavens no , '' she chuckled . `` Only until it is destroyed . After that , you get to disappear into eternal rest . '' `` Oh ... Well , that does n't sound so bad . How do I haunt this ? '' She simply shrugged her shoulders . `` Not my department . I just process the 12-324 forms . I 'm sure you 'll figure something out . My advice is just to focus on one thing , do n't try to do too much . '' She stood up from the bed and gave me a thumbs-up . `` Best of luck to you , sir . '' `` Hold on , '' I said . `` How long have you been doing ... All this ? '' She grimaced , her face screwed up in concentration . `` One hundred ninety-eight years . Only two to go . '' `` Why so long ? '' `` The money 's good , '' she stated simply . And in an instant , she was gone . ~~~ The funny thing is , Melissa and Juliet were really cool people .

I 'd tried everything I could think of : screaming as loud and as long as possible ( you can shout until the sound of your own voice annoys you , saying as you do n't need to breathe ) , banging on walls ( you 'll actually push yourself through solid material before you make a sound ) , and making things go haywire ( I can affect small electronics and electrical systems , but the worst I did was give the radio a bit of static ) . By the end if the third week , I was exhausted , mentally if not physically . While I did n't need sleep , I still took naps to alleviate the boredom .

And sure enough , right where I was sitting , there was a vague , blurry form of a person . There was no detail to it at all , just an outline and two dark circles for eyes .

It was like feeling air . That 's when I suddenly noticed that I could n't feel the ground beneath me , or the clothes against my skin . There was nothing to smell , and it struck me that I was n't breathing , either . `` Holy shit , I 'm actually ... dead ... . '' `` Yes . As for the form , '' she continued politely , `` you 'll find it in your shirt pocket . '' I reached in and produced a small , yellowing scroll , sealed in blood-red wax . I slowly handed it to her , still reeling from the realization that I really , truly had died . And that I was on a Winnebago . A thought occurred to me : I turned to the driver 's area .

Sure , the first day was awful . I 'd tried everything I could think of : screaming as loud and as long as possible ( you can shout until the sound of your own voice annoys you , saying as you do n't need to breathe ) , banging on walls ( you 'll actually push yourself through solid material before you make a sound ) , and making things go haywire ( I can affect small electronics and electrical systems , but the worst I did was give the radio a bit of static ) . By the end if the third week , I was exhausted , mentally if not physically . While I did n't need sleep , I still took naps to alleviate the boredom . I slept on the floor of the Winnebago since I could n't feel discomfort anymore . I had been sleeping on the bed out of habit , but the second night I 'd woken up to them having sex . Even though I was dead , I thought they should have a bit of privacy . I learned a lot about them , being forced to listen to their conversations . They 'd bought the Winnebago from the old couple who 'd killed me , and were driving to Portland . Melissa had a ten-year-old daughter at a private school there who Juliet was in the process of adopting . They were both allergic to cats and loved country music .

By accident , no less . Melissa 's ( and Juliet 's at this point ) daughter Madysynn was along for a drive up to Seattle . Juliet was standing near me , making sandwiches in the kitchenette . Madysynn turned around in the passenger seat and shouted `` smile ! '' I was caught by surprise as she snapped a photo with an old-fashioned Polaroid instant camera . Thinking nothing of it , I continued reading as two of the grandsons sang a lamentation over the body of the third . `` Hey , look at that , '' Madysynn said . `` Does that look like a guy 's face ? '' I froze instantly . No way ... . I got up and crept to where she and Juliet were sitting , watching as the photo developed . Juliet appeared slowly , holding a sandwich and grinning . And sure enough , right where I was sitting , there was a vague , blurry form of a person . There was no detail to it at all , just an outline and two dark circles for eyes . If I had n't personally been sitting there , even I would n't have guessed it was me . `` Ehh , '' Juliet said , `` it 's probably just a bad spot on the film . It 's got ta be 20 years old by now . '' Madysynn looked disappointed . `` How do you know it 's not a ghost ? '' she asked . Melissa laughed . `` How on earth would an RV be haunted ? '' `` I do n't know , '' Madysynn replied , `` maybe it hit someone and they died . '' Melissa and Juliet both went ghostly pale . `` Holy crap !

AMT_U0,"Come little one , I think it is time to tell you and your brothers a story . A story of the reason we are here . But also a warning , as stories we tell often hold .

I 've been watching them for years , but it was still a bit scary . They were all so different , but they were all the same . I wanted to say something , but my brain was nimble . I could n't figure out what they were thinking . I felt like I was losing control , and I was getting scared . `` I think I 'll go to bed now , '' I said . I did n't know how long I was going to stay there , but the thought of going to sleep was too much to bear . I got up and walked out of the room , and walked down the hall .

'' I yelled , at a near sprint with a full cup of water . I burst through the floor to find a shivering Alexander , sitting up-right , and gazing , in awe , directly at the several `` Trippy '' art posters I had on the wall ( for this exact reason , of course ) . `` Here you go buddy , drink this , and let 's talk '' motioning for Alex to take the cup in my hand .

'' at a nearby lamp shade , knocking it on to the ground . `` Alexander , it 's fine , you 're just ... just ... . dreaming ! With your eyes open ! Close your eyes , and you 'll feel better !

Now , I do n't know if you 've ever tripped with an 11 year old before . If you have , I do n't judge , but maybe your situation was similar to mine . Silence is NEVER a good thing with kids , let alone tripping ones . So , as I ran out , I came face to face with what could only be described as horrific . There Alexander was , panting , stark naked in the corner of the living room . How he had managed to get his clothes off before I came in , beats me . But , things were n't getting any better from there . Not only did I have a naked 11 year old psychonaught to deal with , but now I could see his Mom , my sister , pulling up in the driveway .

AMT_D6,"The first human contact with aliens was awkward and distressing . Best described as snail-like sentients , the Aluumu were slow-moving pseudo-molluscs who had developed a sort of organic technology that had allowed them to venture into space . They were old - about 10 billion years older than humanity - yet their technology was just barely beyond our own . But the most astonishing fact was that they did n't understand the concept of *weapons* . Human xenobiologists and xenoanthropologists who studied the Aluumu homeworld were stunned to find a culture and ecosystem that *did not have predators* . This sort of biological harmony meant that the species shared genetics freely across various animals and the Aluumu were actually massive colonies of different species - similar to our terrestrial Chondrophores . At the very basic level , everything on the planet Aluu ingested only inorganic or decaying matter , the lowest organisms converting the matter through to the higher organisms in a beautiful chain of complex biochemistry that left many of our xenobiologists irritatingly excitable . The other problem ( for the Aluumu ) was that they had no concept of *selfishness* . Coming from a global system that only *benefited* from total altruism , they did not understand the human capacity for moral ambiguity - and were therefore easily taken advantage of . Lacking any concept of conflict and finding the concept of war terrifyingly incomprehensible , they ignored our differences and tried to 'integrate ' us into their species by altruistically seeding us with genetic information ; to not only bring about biological perfection by freeing us of disease , but to 'soothe the savage beast ' within us and remove our dominant , violent traits . Humanity , of course , saw this as an attack . The Aluumu had been in contact with many other sentient , space-faring species , as we discovered from their records . What remained of the species after the Aluumu 'wars ' amounted to nothing more than a handful of individuals who were kept in research facilities and used for advanced genetic research . From them , humanity learned to program itself into a biologically superior organism . Like the Aluumu , most of the other alien species had no concept of war , or it had died out in their very ancient past . Organic life in the galaxy , it seemed , was far less like us and far more like the snail-creatures we had practically exterminated . Primed by the terror of the Aluumu 'wars ' , where vast portions of humanity had been 'infected ' with a 'zombie virus ' that made us slow-moving , affable and selflessly co-operative to the point of docility , the Earth corporations who controlled our resource-stripped planet saw an opportunity to demonstrate what would become the defining feature of our species - unbridled greed . Behaving like mobile insect colonies , the Idri were the next to fall , then the Palacatalata - city-sized super organisms comprising of billions of trillions of cooperative single-celled entities . Both put up a token resistance , but both fell quickly to the scourge of humanity . Panicking , the galactic community convened and elected the Rovak - the only other race with a vaguely war-like history - to head their battle fleets . But humanity , having taken such pleasure in genetically engineering super-soldiers and reverse-engineering alien biotech , had built massive , unstoppable juggernauts in preparation for what we saw as an 'inevitable ' conflict with another species like ourselves . To say the war was one-sided is being generous . It was a massacre to make previous human genocides feel comforting and benign . Aided by the hideous , arachnid appearance of the Rovak and an 'insurmountable ' language barrier , the human troops thought they were simply making pre-emptive strikes against an aggressor hell-bent on wiping us out . Certainly it looked that way to the average citizen - planet after planet of newly-built alien military outposts , strategically positioned against Earth and its colonies . Fearing an end in the same manner as the Aluumu , the Idri and the Palacatalata , the galactic races surrendered to humanity and begged for their lives . In the aftermath , we sit here , rulers of the galaxy , virtual Terror Gods to these gentle , placid aliens . Aliens who learned the art of war far too late ; just as we learned the art of *peace* far too late . Humanity is treated with such deference and reverence on the alien populated worlds that it is *embarrassing* to step foot on whatever passes for their streets .

Other races , like the Yu , will simply commit mass ritual suicide on sight of a human being , so we can not even set foot on their worlds . The damage we have done to this galaxy is utterly beyond repair . There is no way back from this ; even should humanity become like the Yu and commit massive , galactic suicide , the other races will never recover what they once had .

I laughed , and looked at him . He laughed . `` Now , I have a sword ? '' This was the first time I had ever heard of a sword , and it was the most interesting thing I had seen . `` Yes , '' I said . The woman said , looking at me . `` How do you know ? '' She asked . She handed me the sword . I took it , but it was too heavy . I thought it was a sword and it seemed to be very heavy . `` Do you know how to use it ? `` , I asked , and a smile came over my face . The stranger looked at my face , and smiled . `` The sword is a sword of the gods , '' it said .",5,2
AMT_KG,"The first human contact with aliens was awkward and distressing . Best described as snail-like sentients , the Aluumu were slow-moving pseudo-molluscs who had developed a sort of organic technology that had allowed them to venture into space .

AMT_D6,"It was about noon in my dunghole of an office when it happened . I had just loosened my tie and drawn my state-issued dagger given to interpreters of the law , and my underpaid intern ( whom which I had no idea why she bothered to stick around ) had equipped her shoes in her hand , the two of us cornering a fairly large basilisk-cockroach , when someone opened the door . I looked up at the door in surprise , as normally criminals tended to want to pay off the crown or take the axe , and the basilisk-cockroach grasped the opportunity and slithered away into the gap between tables . My intern lunged for it , with a large smack hit the floor and continued to slide until her head hit the end of one of the tables , all the while I gazed at the figure stepping in from the dusty blue-gray sunlight . `` Royal State Lawyer Isiah Joneson ?

I sheathed my cheap ceremonial dagger at my side and hastily fixed my tie as I approached the man . `` Present , '' I replied . `` Ah , '' he began , `` Fantastic . The Royal Court has appointed you the lawyer of a new defendant . '' He thrust what I assumed was a summons to me , rolled and sealed with red wax stamped with the royal seal . `` Under penalty of losing the powers bestowed to you by the Royal Court , you are obligated to- '' `` Yes , yes , you do n't have to recite the whole damned thing . '' I waved irritably at him , but he seemed relieved . He bowed stiffly , as apparently a man living in a basilisk-cockroach dump of a stone-bricked office was officially higher rank than a decorated man that walked the streets with paudrons of gold thread . `` The Royal Court appreciates your service , '' he said stiffly . And then he was gone , back out into the dusty blue-grey sunlight outside . My intern stood up shakily , holding onto the table for balance , and brushing a loose hair back behind her ear . `` What is it this time , '' she inquired , `` Another smart-mouthed treasonist ? '' `` I hope not , '' I breathed as I slid over to my desk to look for my letter opener . Unable to find it , I drew my knife ( which by the way should never be used in any of the ways I have used it thus far ) and cut the wax seal in half . `` Ah , '' I said , beginning to read the parchment as I unrolled it . `` It seems we shall be representing a smart-mouthed dragon instead .

'' The dragon 's voice shook the fireproof , scratchproof , shatterproof , smashproof , and generally dragonproof ( though strangely not musketproof so I heard ) sheet of glass that separated us . The voice of the dragon carried through the glass , but I held a phone with my shoulder as I scrambled through my notes and papers of ancients laws that my intern had helped prepare . Truthfully , the dragon was a much better student of the law than I , having been present when it was made , but it seemed the Royal Court outlawed self-representation in front of a judge . As it was , I was to represent this dragon and try to make a case for him . `` Druk , then .

I sat in disbelief at what I was hearing . `` Could you repeat that for me ? '' I asked meekly . `` I am innocent of it all , and I can prove it . '' -- -- The first day at the Royal Court , I found myself a nervous wreck in the washroom . There were crews of newscasters with their live cameras and crystal balls all trying to push into the building , trying to get a piece of the best scoop of the century . It was cacophonaic chaos . My intern was busy going through some final notes with the dragon . It had been a very busy few weeks , leading up to this heartpounding moment , but the quiet of the washroom calmed me . I splashed more water into my face . `` You can do this , '' I confidently assured the face in the mirror . I stood up and attempted to fix my tie again . Satisfied , I turned and found myself face-to-face with a member of the royam family , whom I had n't noticed come in . `` Prince Tyran ! '' I nearly screamed . He smiled back at me as he took off his gloves . `` Isiah . Hello . '' He smiled . `` Quite the event today for you , is n't it ? '' I did n't like his smooth voice . `` What do you want , milord ? '' I tried to ask kindly . `` Oh , to the point . I do suppose , yes , you are short on time . '' He glanced to the door . `` Well , I shalll make this short . '' Like a whirling whirlstorm , he spun his sword out of sheath and to my neck , pushing me against the wall . `` The dragon is not to win . '' He hissed . `` You understand ? That dragon does not win , and I will not touch your life - or your intern 's . '' I pushed him off and carefully pulled the tip of his sword away . `` His name is Druk , '' I stated as I fixed my tie again , pushing out of the lixurious washroom into the mess of noise outside . -- -- I fingered the hilt of my dagger absently . Druk and my intern sat behind me expectantly . Druk somehow managed a subtle nod , something that I had thought previously impossible . I turned back to face the Royal Court seated high above me . At the forefront sat the Queen , her King seated to her right . Far to my left sat the Prince who had threatened me moments ago . His face had a gentle smile . I flashed him a small grin , and watched his face slowly turn to pure horror . I began . `` Your Grace , I will show to the Royal Court that , undoubtedly , my client , the dragon known as Druk , is completely innocent of all his crimes and without fault - '' The room exploded before I could finish . I continued , yelling above the excited talking . `` -Without fault for the crimes of the murder of two-thousand and ninety two citizens , without fault for the assault of seventeen-thousand and fourty citizens , without fault for the destruction of countless amounts of property across our fair kingdom , and that he has been in fact grossly misrepresented and slandered by the media , ( especially in the case of the hooker from the Capitol ) and that none of these acts were caused by him ! Rather ! I will prove to you that my client has been framed for these crimes ! '' The room was at a deafening volume at that . The prosecution asked the Royal Court that we would ajourn for the day . They granted the request .","The Lord of Hell rhythmically tapped the desktop as she pondered the mystery that has haunted Hell for past two centuries . The number of souls that dwelled within Hell was reaching zero , and the flow of souls to Hell had stopped . No current statistical interpretation could explain it ; nobody in the entirety of Hell could explain it . It irked her greatly . The last time she had been so baffled was when the number of souls damned per thousand had dropped in the nineteenth century , and stayed there.At first she had sought an explanation among the myriad of churches . Then she had realized that the change came from outside the church ! It had taken a millennium , but it seemed that humanity was slowly creating its own code of ethics , rather than using the Lord of Heaven ’ s . Something she certainly would not have bet on . Had humanity had finally learned something from Job ? The population of Hell was strongly correlated to the population of Earth . This was an unshakable trend for millennia . There would always be sinners , no matter how hard the social reformers worked , due to free will . The only way to rid the world of sinners was to rid the world of free will , and to rid the world of free will was also a sin . The only thing that would change would be the characters sent to Hell . And yet this was happening ! She was infuriated that she had lost another bet to the Lord of Heaven . What was even more grating was that she had no idea how it had happened . “ Your coffee , Mistress. ” Murmured a soft voice from behind . The imbecile should be grateful she didn ’ t vaporize him for having the audacity to enter her domain without knocking , but he was too useful to be killed , especially as there were few left in Hell . Instead she absentmindedly accepted the cup . Coffee was one of the few items imported from Earth . The ingenuity of humanity lately was astonishing , compared to a millenium before ... . The cup fell to the floor , ignored as she had an epipheny . Could it be ? ! She rushed downstairs to meet the few souls in Hell that remained . At the beginning , Hell was able to deal with the damned on a face-to-face basis . Her underlings made it a sport to figure out each soul ’ s psychology in order to administer the maximum amount of pain with the least of amount of effort . Hell in this era resembled the stereotype : chains , whips , and blood . Janitors were prized more than torturers in those days . However , around the twentieth century the population of Earth exploded , and thus the population of Hell exploded . At first she had stuck with the old methods , creating a waiting list to enter Hell ( possibly the most evil thing she had ever done ) Soon she realized Soon she realized Hell would have to adapt or its job would never be done . So Hell had automated suffering . Each soul received a small cell , and the environment was designed to make the inhabitant as miserable as possible . Loud noises for long-term sleep deprivation . Several varieties of pathogens , from severe nausea to fungi inhabiting the genitals . They were hung from the ceiling by their thumbs . They were nude . The worst was probably the perennial solitary confinement . Some of the mind games her underlings thought of disturbed even her . For the first time in centuries there was a devil in the same room as a human . To the Lord of Hell ’ s amusement , he looked pleased to see another face . That pleasure didn ’ t last , as the only thing she did before leaving was tear an arm off . Her hunch had been right . What had once been a being made of flesh , bone , and organs was now of metal , wires , and computers . She was torn between hysterical laughter and abject rage . For now she knew why the flow of souls to Hell had ceased . The dichotomy of Heaven and Hell only existed as long as humanity was born from the Hand of God . As they were now of metal rather than dust , Hell no longer had a grip on their souls . Humanity had found a way to opt out of the latest bet between God and Satan . Just as God had predicted . Dammit . At least she had a way to get back at the bastard . Around the world , the following message was heard : `` We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty . Congratulations Humanity , you have thwarted a game between Gods. ``",4,5

AMT_1U,"It was about noon in my dunghole of an office when it happened . I had just loosened my tie and drawn my state-issued dagger given to interpreters of the law , and my underpaid intern ( whom which I had no idea why she bothered to stick around ) had equipped her shoes in her hand , the two of us cornering a fairly large basilisk-cockroach , when someone opened the door . I looked up at the door in surprise , as normally criminals tended to want to pay off the crown or take the axe , and the basilisk-cockroach grasped the opportunity and slithered away into the gap between tables . My intern lunged for it , with a large smack hit the floor and continued to slide until her head hit the end of one of the tables , all the while I gazed at the figure stepping in from the dusty blue-gray sunlight . `` Royal State Lawyer Isiah Joneson ? '' asked the man that I now recogized as a baliff sent by the upper levels of our uncaring government , recogized mostly by the obvious gilded trims on his jacket . I sheathed my cheap ceremonial dagger at my side and hastily fixed my tie as I approached the man . `` Present , '' I replied . `` Ah , '' he began , `` Fantastic . The Royal Court has appointed you the lawyer of a new defendant . '' He thrust what I assumed was a summons to me , rolled and sealed with red wax stamped with the royal seal . `` Under penalty of losing the powers bestowed to you by the Royal Court , you are obligated to- '' `` Yes , yes , you do n't have to recite the whole damned thing . '' I waved irritably at him , but he seemed relieved . He bowed stiffly , as apparently a man living in a basilisk-cockroach dump of a stone-bricked office was officially higher rank than a decorated man that walked the streets with paudrons of gold thread . `` The Royal Court appreciates your service , '' he said stiffly . And then he was gone , back out into the dusty blue-grey sunlight outside . My intern stood up shakily , holding onto the table for balance , and brushing a loose hair back behind her ear . `` What is it this time , '' she inquired , `` Another smart-mouthed treasonist ? '' `` I hope not , '' I breathed as I slid over to my desk to look for my letter opener . Unable to find it , I drew my knife ( which by the way should never be used in any of the ways I have used it thus far ) and cut the wax seal in half . `` Ah , '' I said , beginning to read the parchment as I unrolled it . `` It seems we shall be representing a smart-mouthed dragon instead . '' Today was looking up . -- -- `` Now Mister- '' `` Drop the mistur . Druk , I prefer . '' The dragon 's voice shook the fireproof , scratchproof , shatterproof , smashproof , and generally dragonproof ( though strangely not musketproof so I heard ) sheet of glass that separated us . The voice of the dragon carried through the glass , but I held a phone with my shoulder as I scrambled through my notes and papers of ancients laws that my intern had helped prepare . Truthfully , the dragon was a much better student of the law than I , having been present when it was made , but it seemed the Royal Court outlawed self-representation in front of a judge . As it was , I was to represent this dragon and try to make a case for him . `` Druk , then . You 've been accused of hundreds of accounts of manslaughter , more cases of assault , '' I paused at one of the claimes , `` Apparently a single case of sexual harassment - '' `` I will admit to that one , '' Druk huffed with a swirl of smoke . I looked up at him , and it very definitely seemed like he was smiling . `` Anyways , those and the unfathamable amount of property damage . '' `` Ever hear of insurance fraud ? '' he huffed with another rumble . My quill tipped over with the shaking . I quickly snatched it back up before it splotched over all my notes . `` Well , regardless , I do n't see a way to dismiss all the charges or get you out of this .

His huge reptilian eyes squinted back at me . `` We could use an insanity defense , but I ca n't in good conscience let you fly free , not when you 're accused of taking this many lives . '' `` No . '' I recoiled in my uncomfortable dungeon chair . `` What no ? '' `` I did not do any of it , '' was the rumbled snarl , accompanied with a spot of flame .

'' I sighed as I adjusted my tie and switched shoulders for the phone . `` Some of the murders I can get you off of by using the Vigilante Ruling of 812 , which will get you about a month of prison for offense , but these are human lives here . '' I put my notes down and locked eyes with him . His huge reptilian eyes squinted back at me . `` We could use an insanity defense , but I ca n't in good conscience let you fly free , not when you 're accused of taking this many lives . '' `` No . '' I recoiled in my uncomfortable dungeon chair . `` What no ? '' `` I did not do any of it , '' was the rumbled snarl , accompanied with a spot of flame . I sat in disbelief at what I was hearing . `` Could you repeat that for me ? '' I asked meekly . `` I am innocent of it all , and I can prove it . '' -- -- The first day at the Royal Court , I found myself a nervous wreck in the washroom . There were crews of newscasters with their live cameras and crystal balls all trying to push into the building , trying to get a piece of the best scoop of the century . It was cacophonaic chaos . My intern was busy going through some final notes with the dragon . It had been a very busy few weeks , leading up to this heartpounding moment , but the quiet of the washroom calmed me . I splashed more water into my face . `` You can do this , '' I confidently assured the face in the mirror . I stood up and attempted to fix my tie again . Satisfied , I turned and found myself face-to-face with a member of the royam family , whom I had n't noticed come in . `` Prince Tyran ! '' I nearly screamed . He smiled back at me as he took off his gloves . `` Isiah . Hello . '' He smiled . `` Quite the event today for you , is n't it ? '' I did n't like his smooth voice . `` What do you want , milord ? '' I tried to ask kindly . `` Oh , to the point . I do suppose , yes , you are short on time . '' He glanced to the door . `` Well , I shalll make this short . '' Like a whirling whirlstorm , he spun his sword out of sheath and to my neck , pushing me against the wall . `` The dragon is not to win . '' He hissed . `` You understand ? That dragon does not win , and I will not touch your life - or your intern 's . '' I pushed him off and carefully pulled the tip of his sword away . `` His name is Druk , '' I stated as I fixed my tie again , pushing out of the lixurious washroom into the mess of noise outside . -- -- I fingered the hilt of my dagger absently . Druk and my intern sat behind me expectantly . Druk somehow managed a subtle nod , something that I had thought previously impossible . I turned back to face the Royal Court seated high above me . At the forefront sat the Queen , her King seated to her right . Far to my left sat the Prince who had threatened me moments ago . His face had a gentle smile . I flashed him a small grin , and watched his face slowly turn to pure horror . I began . `` Your Grace , I will show to the Royal Court that , undoubtedly , my client , the dragon known as Druk , is completely innocent of all his crimes and without fault - '' The room exploded before I could finish . I continued , yelling above the excited talking . `` -Without fault for the crimes of the murder of two-thousand and ninety two citizens , without fault for the assault of seventeen-thousand and fourty citizens , without fault for the destruction of countless amounts of property across our fair kingdom , and that he has been in fact grossly misrepresented and slandered by the media , ( especially in the case of the hooker from the Capitol ) and that none of these acts were caused by him ! Rather ! I will prove to you that my client has been framed for these crimes ! '' The room was at a deafening volume at that . The prosecution asked the Royal Court that we would ajourn for the day . They granted the request .","The Lord of Hell rhythmically tapped the desktop as she pondered the mystery that has haunted Hell for past two centuries . The number of souls that dwelled within Hell was reaching zero , and the flow of souls to Hell had stopped . No current statistical interpretation could explain it ; nobody in the entirety of Hell could explain it . It irked her greatly . The last time she had been so baffled was when the number of souls damned per thousand had dropped in the nineteenth century , and stayed there.At first she had sought an explanation among the myriad of churches . Then she had realized that the change came from outside the church ! It had taken a millennium , but it seemed that humanity was slowly creating its own code of ethics , rather than using the Lord of Heaven ’ s . Something she certainly would not have bet on . Had humanity had finally learned something from Job ? The population of Hell was strongly correlated to the population of Earth . This was an unshakable trend for millennia . There would always be sinners , no matter how hard the social reformers worked , due to free will . The only way to rid the world of sinners was to rid the world of free will , and to rid the world of free will was also a sin . The only thing that would change would be the characters sent to Hell . And yet this was happening ! She was infuriated that she had lost another bet to the Lord of Heaven . What was even more grating was that she had no idea how it had happened . “ Your coffee , Mistress. ” Murmured a soft voice from behind . The imbecile should be grateful she didn ’ t vaporize him for having the audacity to enter her domain without knocking , but he was too useful to be killed , especially as there were few left in Hell . Instead she absentmindedly accepted the cup . Coffee was one of the few items imported from Earth . The ingenuity of humanity lately was astonishing , compared to a millenium before ... . The cup fell to the floor , ignored as she had an epipheny . Could it be ? ! She rushed downstairs to meet the few souls in Hell that remained . At the beginning , Hell was able to deal with the damned on a face-to-face basis . Her underlings made it a sport to figure out each soul ’ s psychology in order to administer the maximum amount of pain with the least of amount of effort . Hell in this era resembled the stereotype : chains , whips , and blood . Janitors were prized more than torturers in those days . However , around the twentieth century the population of Earth exploded , and thus the population of Hell exploded . At first she had stuck with the old methods , creating a waiting list to enter Hell ( possibly the most evil thing she had ever done ) Soon she realized Soon she realized Hell would have to adapt or its job would never be done . So Hell had automated suffering . Each soul received a small cell , and the environment was designed to make the inhabitant as miserable as possible . Loud noises for long-term sleep deprivation . Several varieties of pathogens , from severe nausea to fungi inhabiting the genitals . They were hung from the ceiling by their thumbs . They were nude . The worst was probably the perennial solitary confinement . Some of the mind games her underlings thought of disturbed even her . For the first time in centuries there was a devil in the same room as a human . To the Lord of Hell ’ s amusement , he looked pleased to see another face . That pleasure didn ’ t last , as the only thing she did before leaving was tear an arm off . Her hunch had been right . What had once been a being made of flesh , bone , and organs was now of metal , wires , and computers . She was torn between hysterical laughter and abject rage . For now she knew why the flow of souls to Hell had ceased . The dichotomy of Heaven and Hell only existed as long as humanity was born from the Hand of God . As they were now of metal rather than dust , Hell no longer had a grip on their souls . Humanity had found a way to opt out of the latest bet between God and Satan . Just as God had predicted . Dammit . At least she had a way to get back at the bastard . Around the world , the following message was heard : `` We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty . Congratulations Humanity , you have thwarted a game between Gods. ``",5,5
